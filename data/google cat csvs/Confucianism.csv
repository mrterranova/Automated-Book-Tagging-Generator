China's New Confucianism,['Daniel A. Bell'],2008,['History'],"What is it like to be a Westerner teaching political philosophy in an officially Marxist state? Why do Chinese sex workers sing karaoke with their customers? And why do some Communist Party cadres get promoted if they care for their elderly parents? In this entertaining and illuminating book, one of the few Westerners to teach at a Chinese university draws on his personal experiences to paint an unexpected portrait of a society undergoing faster and more sweeping changes than anywhere else on earth. With a storyteller's eye for detail, Daniel Bell observes the rituals, routines, and tensions of daily life in China. China's New Confucianism makes the case that as the nation retreats from communism, it is embracing a new Confucianism that offers a compelling alternative to Western liberalism. Bell provides an insider's account of Chinese culture and, along the way, debunks a variety of stereotypes. He presents the startling argument that Confucian social hierarchy can actually contribute to economic equality in China. He covers such diverse social topics as sex, sports, and the treatment of domestic workers. He considers the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, wondering whether Chinese overcompetitiveness might be tempered by Confucian civility. And he looks at education in China, showing the ways Confucianism impacts his role as a political theorist and teacher. By examining the challenges that arise as China adapts ancient values to contemporary society, China's New Confucianism enriches the dialogue of possibilities available to this rapidly evolving nation.",N/A,N/A,en

The Land of Scholars,['Chae-ŏn Kang'],2006,['History'],"This book discusses the historical development of Korean Confucianism in terms of its social functions. It also examines the types of transfiguration Confucianism underwent and the role it played in each period of Korean history. The Land of Scholars spans from the Three Kingdoms period in 18 BC to the Joseon dynasty in 1910. The book not only gives a comprehensive and in-depth survey of the history of Korean Confucian thought but also touches on the transmission of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Christianity in Korea. Kang Jae-eun approaches the significance of Confucianism from the perspective of its cultural and social context. He explains Confucianism from a viewpoint that reflects on exchanges between Korea and Japan and the broader context of East Asian relationships. Kang also challenges the views of some Korean academics whose works on Confucianism are considered to be distortions and misinterpretations. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Born in 1926 in Korea, Kang Jae-eun earned his PhD in literature from Kyoto University in Japan. For twenty-two years, he has been the editor of Samcheolli (Three thousand li) and Cheonggu (Korea), quarterly magazines that act as a forum and compass for Korean residents in Japan. Professor Kang is regarded as one of the foremost historians that led the Japanese academia after the liberation of Korea. His other books include Modern Thoughts of Korea and A Study of the Modern History of Korea in Japanese.

Confucianism,['Ronnie Littlejohn'],2011,['Philosophy'],"It is arguably Confucianism, not Communism, which lies at the core of China's deepest sense of self. Although reviled by Chinese intellectuals of the 1950s-1990s, who spoke of it as 'yellow silt clotting the arteries of the country', Confucianism has defied eradication, remaining a fundamental part of the nation's soul for 2500 years. And now, as China assumes greater ascendancy on the world economic stage, it is making a strong comeback as a pragmatic philosophy of personal as well as corporate transformation, popular in both home and boardroom. What is this complex system of ideology that stems from the teachings of a remarkable man called Confucius (Kongzi), who lived in the distant sixth century BCE? Though he left no writings of his own, the oral teachings recorded by the founder's disciples in the 'Analects' left a profound mark on later Chinese politics and governance. They outline a system of social cohesiveness dependent upon personal virtue and self-control. For Confucius, society's harmony relied upon the appropriate behaviour of each individual within the social hierarchy; and its emphasis on practical ethics has led many to think of Confucianism as a secular philosophy rather than a religion. In this new, comprehensive introduction, Ronnie Littlejohn argues rather that Confucianism is profoundly spiritual, and must be treated as such. He offers full coverage of the tradition's sometimes neglected metaphysics, as well as its varied manifestations in education, art, literature and culture.",N/A,N/A,en

First, archeological findings are used to uncover the meaning of passages obscured for thousands of years. Second, it preserves the flavor of the original in a poetic rendition. An introductory part of this book provides the historical and philosophical background to the I Ching . The story is told of the ancient Chinese civilization, pointing out events and figures mentioned in the I Ching . The undisguised face of the I Ching will appeal to the modern reader, who will read it in his or her own individual way, as poetry, as discoverer of self, or as soothsayer. It is in the grand tradition of the I Ching for different people to see different things.: To Confucius, who was born in 550 B.C., it was a source of ethics.; To Leibnitz, the eighteenth-century inventor of calculus, it was the essence of binary mathematics.; To Jung Freud''s rival in psychology, it was an explorer of the unconscious.; To some Wall Streeters, it predicts the stock market.

Certainly no other world figure has ever been presented as more of an exemplar to his countrymen. Yet what we know about the man himself is vague and shadowy, and the sayings attributed to him may seem obscure to the Westerner. Raymond Dawson addresses these paradoxes. Taking as a model the Chinese tradition of commentary on classical texts--in this case the Analects, the oldest and most reliable Confucian text--he finds a body of thought whose expression does seem to reflect the views and aspirations of a recognizable person. He shows how the separate components of the Master's thought cohere into a distinct social, ethical, and intellectual system. Dawson elucidates the contemporary applicability of the sayings as well as the strength of their influence throughout the two and a half millennia of their currency, even in a China that has formally rejected them.""-- provided by publisher.",N/A,N/A,en

Using a wide range of sources from Vietnam, France, and the United States, many of them previously unexploited, he shows how the use of printed matter soared between 1920 and 1945 and in the process transformed Vietnamese public life and shaped the modern Vietnamese consciousnesss. Print and Power examines the impact of the French colonial state on Vietnamese society as well as Vietnamese and East Asian understandings of public discourse and public space.

中庸,['Confucius'],1971,['Philosophy'],"Central to the study of Chinese civilization at its widest extension is the thought of the great sage K'ung, usually known in the West by the Latinized form of his name, Confucius. His works form the core of more than two thousand years of Oriental civilization, and even today, when he has been officially discarded, his thought remains important for understanding the present as well as the past. Yet Confucius is the property of not only the Orientalists: his ideas stood behind much of the rational social thought of the European Enlightenment, as great philosophers from Leibnitz on seized with delight ""the perfect ethic without supernaturalism: that China offered them. The present edition of the wisdom of Confucius is certainly the best edition ever prepared in the West.

In addition to the texts and translation, a wealth of helpful material is offered to the reader: countless notes embodying textual studies, commentators' opinions, interpretation of individual characters, disputed meanings, and similar material.

This modern classic of Confucian interpretation by Fingarette, one of the most eminent philosophers of his day, sparked an intellectual revolution and has inspired generations of sinologists since its publication. While remaining scrupulously faithful to the text of the Analects of Confucius, the book discerns the deepest meaning of Confucius' thought and examines its application to the present day. By exploring the Analects, Fingarette invites us to reconsider what makes life worth living. As one scholar has noted, it is as if Fingarette holds a magical key to the profound insights of Confucius. As Fingarette said in his Preface, ""Confucius can be a teacher to us today... He tells us things not being said elsewhere; things needing to be said. He has a new lesson to teach."" Confucius: The Secular as Sacred succeeds, as few books do, to recall us to our humanity.

Towards Confucian Republicanism,['Elton Chan'],2025,['Philosophy'],"Over the last century, Confucianism has been searching for a place in the modern political world. This ancient tradition was once the philosophical cornerstone upon which powerful political orders were built, but the collapse of monarchies in the twentieth century has removed Confucianism from its institutional manifestations. And despite the liberal turn of Confucianism in the 1950s that sought to adopt liberal democracy as the tradition's political future, there appears to be an increasing revival of the authoritarian strands of thought among Confucian scholarship. In Towards Confucian Republicanism, Elton Chan develops a theoretical framework of Confucianism for the twenty-first century. Chan argues that liberal Confucians must take seriously the internal authoritarian leanings of Confucianism--and then argue against such strands of the Confucian tradition. He shows that Confucians are keen on concentrating power in the hands of the virtuous not merely for promoting order and material livelihood, but also for general moral cultivation. Yet this use of political and moral hierarchy as institutional platforms for perfectionist development is self-defeating. To counter the authoritarian turn in Confucian scholarship, Chan articulates a vision of a hybrid political order that brings together Confucianism and republican democracy. He makes the case that Confucianism stands a much higher chance of achieving its political and moral ideals--good governance and collective virtuous cultivation--when merged with republicanism. Covering a uniquely wide range of Confucian classics and outlining his novel vision for Confucianism, Chan addresses pressing issues in contemporary political philosophy, including virtue politics, balance of power, civic education, public reason constraint, and the role of civil society. In so doing, Chan convincingly argues that to materialize Confucianism's ideals is to collectively practice democracy as a virtuous way of life.",N/A,N/A,en

Confucian Constitutionalism,['Sungmoon Kim'],2023,['Philosophy'],"In Confucian Constitutionalism, Sungmoon Kim presents a constitutional theory of democratic self-government that is normatively appealing and politically practicable in East Asia's historically Confucian societies, which are increasingly pluralist, multicultural, and rights sensitive. While Confucian political theorists are preoccupied with how to build a Confucianism-inspired institution that would make a given polity more meritorious, Kim offers a robust normative theory of Confucian constitutionalism--what he calls ""Confucian democratic constitutionalism""--with special attention to value pluralism and moral disagreement. Aiming to contribute to both political theory and comparative law, Confucian Constitutionalism explains how Confucian democratic constitutionalism differs from and improves upon liberal legal constitutionalism, political constitutionalism, and Confucian meritocratic constitutionalism.",N/A,N/A,en

Confucianism as a World Religion,['Anna Xiao Dong Sun'],2013,['History'],"Is Confucianism a religion? If so, why do most Chinese think it isn't? From ancient Confucian temples, to nineteenth-century archives, to the testimony of people interviewed by the author throughout China over a period of more than a decade, this book traces the birth and growth of the idea of Confucianism as a world religion. The book begins at Oxford, in the late nineteenth century, when Friedrich Max Müller and James Legge classified Confucianism as a world religion in the new discourse of ""world religions"" and the emerging discipline of comparative religion. Anna Sun shows how that decisive moment continues to influence the understanding of Confucianism in the contemporary world, not only in the West but also in China, where the politics of Confucianism has become important to the present regime in a time of transition. Contested histories of Confucianism are vital signs of social and political change. Sun also examines the revival of Confucianism in contemporary China and the social significance of the ritual practice of Confucian temples. While the Chinese government turns to Confucianism to justify its political agenda, Confucian activists have started a movement to turn Confucianism into a religion. Confucianism as a world religion might have begun as a scholarly construction, but are we witnessing its transformation into a social and political reality? With historical analysis, extensive research, and thoughtful reflection, Confucianism as a World Religion will engage all those interested in religion and global politics at the beginning of the Chinese century.",N/A,N/A,en

Today it commands considerable attention in current debates on Asian values raging in classrooms and boardrooms in both East Asia and the West. This volume, which represents the work of fifteen respected scholars of early Chinese thought and culture, is an especially timely effort to bring the Mencius under fresh scrutiny. Making use of recently excavated manuscripts, the contributors approach the Mencius from novel perspectives, challenge established interpretations, and confront anew issues that continue to attract and divide students of this classic text. The famous Mencian doctrine of the goodness of human nature forms one main focus. Questions of context and interpretation bring into sharp relief key hermeneutical issues that surround the text: Does the Mencius present a coherent and systematically developed ethical teaching?

Confucianism and Family Rituals in Imperial China,['Patricia Buckley Ebrey'],2016-04-03,['History'],"To explore the historical connections between Confucianism and Chinese society, this book examines the social and cultural processes through which Confucian texts on family rituals were written, circulated, interpreted, and used as guides to action. Weddings, funerals, and ancestral rites were central features of Chinese culture; they gave drama to transitions in people's lives and conveyed conceptions of the hierarchy of society and the interdependency of the living and the dead. Patricia Ebrey's social history of Confucian texts shows much about how Chinese culture was created in a social setting, through the participation of people at all social levels. Books, like Chu Hsi's Family Rituals and its dozens of revisions, were important in forming ritual behavior in China because of the general respect for literature, the early spread of printing, and the absence of an ecclesiastic establishment authorized to rule on the acceptability of variations in ritual behavior. Ebrey shows how more and more of what people commonly did was approved in the liturgies and thus brought into the realm labeled Confucian. Originally published in 1991.

Writings on China,['Gottfried Wilhelm Freiherr von Leibniz'],1994,['Philosophy'],"Although Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz is best known as a metaphysician, mathematician, and logician, he arguably used the word ""China"" in his voluminous writings and correspondence more often than those terms usually associated with him: ""entelechies,"" ""monads,"" ""pre-established harmony,"" and so forth. If so, then his sustained writings on things Chinese -- especially on Chinese philosophy and religion -- should take their place alongside his other major works such as the Theodicy, Discourse on Metaphysics, Monadology, and the New Essays Concerning Human Understanding. His more detailed writings on China (as opposed to brief references to it, which he regularly made in his correspondence) can be roughly divided into two categories. The first is the letters he wrote to European -- usually Jesuit -- missionaries in China, or their peers in Europe. Especially is this true of his correspondence with Joachim Bouvet, one of the first French Jesuits to live in China, and whose letters to Leibniz clearly influenced the philosopher. -- Preface (p.

It traces the development of Confucian thought, examines significant new texts, and shows how New Confucianism relates to various spheres of life, how it informs views on key philosophical issues, and how it affects personal conduct. Starting by exploring the philosophical and ideological principles of New Confucianism, the book goes on to explain how New Confucianism is a collective process of continuous creation and recreation, an incessant and evolving discourse. It argues that New Confucianism, unlike its earlier manifestation, is more accommodating of a plurality of ideologies in the world; and that understanding Confucianism and how it is developing is essential for understanding contemporary China.",N/A,N/A,en

Tu manages to elucidate the original text while building on it in new and exciting ways. He has a clear grasp of the inner logic which is the engine of Chung yung's thought, and best of all, he is able to communicate it clearly in his own text. It is impossible to think about teaching a class in early Confucian thought without recommending this book. If it were a graduate class, Centrality and Commonality would have to be required reading. (Because) it is extraordinarily lucid about a very difficult topic, I wouldn't hesitate to use this book in an undergraduate class (as well).  Warren G. Frisina, Rice University This kind of interpretative essay is precisely what is needed to persuade Western philosophers and general humanists to take the Chinese texts seriously as a resource for alternative conceptual structures. Tu's main contribution lies in the quality of his insight into the important differences between 'person,' as defined in the Confucian context, and the dominant Western understandings. Given the ease with which it reads, I would target this work for classroom use.  Roger T. Ames, University of Hawaii Tu is to be commended for bringing the rich resources of Chinese thought and culture into the midst of modern discussions that simultaneously encompass and transcend diverse cultures and their values within the scope of common human issues. He boldly confronts the seminal crisis of our times and amply demonstrates his ability to bring an insightful, creative intellect to bear upon the questions posed. In addition, his depth of personal commitment to the subject is very much in evidence and enriches this scholarly study with a unique dimension of human-ness.  Sandra A. Wawrytko, San Diego State University Tu amplifies and clarifies the key patterns of thought in the text and succeeds in interweaving them into a richly textured and holistic Confucian Weltanschauung. I like the book because it is provocative. Tu's interpretation challenges the conventional wisdom that Confucianism is a purely rational and secular ethical system. His style is lucidalthough the subject is both complex and difficultand any intelligent general reader would enjoy the work and learn a great deal.  Leo S. Chang, Harvard University",N/A,N/A,en

Against Individualism,['Henry Rosemont'],2016-11-14,['Philosophy'],"The first part of Against Individualism: A Confucian Rethinking of the Foundations of Morality, Politics, Family, and Religion is devoted to showing how and why the vision of human beings as free, independent and autonomous individuals is and always was a mirage that has served liberatory functions in the past, but has now become pernicious for even thinking clearly about, much less achieving social and economic justice, maintaining democracy, or addressing the manifold environmental and other problems facing the world today. In the second and larger part of the book Rosemont proffers a different vision of being human gleaned from the texts of classical Confucianism, namely, that we are first and foremost interrelated and thus interdependent persons whose uniqueness lies in the multiplicity of roles we each live throughout our lives. This leads to an ethics based on those mutual roles in sharp contrast to individualist moralities, but which nevertheless reflect the facts of our everyday lives very well. The book concludes by exploring briefly a number of implications of this vision for thinking differently about politics, family life, justice, and the development of a human-centered authentic religiousness. This book will be of value to all students and scholars of philosophy, political theory, and Religious, Chinese, and Family Studies, as well as everyone interested in the intersection of morality with their everyday and public lives.",N/A,N/A,en

The Dynamics of Confucianism and Modernization in Korean History,['Tʻae-jin Yi'],2007,['History'],"This volume makes available for the first time in English a collection of the work of historian Yi Tae-Jin. Over the course of his career, he has done path-breaking research that covers virtually the entire Chosōn period (1392-1910) from the Koryō-Chosōn transition to the Kojong period and Korea's takeover by Japan in 1910. One of the focal points of his scholarship has been to reinterpret Neo-Confucianism as a dynamic force in Korean history. The first half of this volume is devoted to his seminal work on the historical factors behind the founding of the Chosōn dynasty. He has shown how the rise of Neo-Confucianism during the Koryō-Chosōn transition was tied to unprecedented advances in agriculture and medicine that led to a fundamental socio-economic transformation of Korea. A new social class emerged that became a leading force behind the new dynasty and adopted Neo-Confucianism as its ideology. One of the underlying concerns of his scholarship has been to overcome the legacy of Japanese colonial scholarship on Korean historiography. His work refutes the notion of Korea as a ""Hermit Kingdom"" that was stagnant for centuries before its opening to the West. The second half of the volume includes some of his work on modernization efforts in the late Chosōn period, as well as some of his more direct critiques of the continuing influence of Japanese historiography in Korea.",N/A,N/A,en

The dominance of Neo-Confucian social hierarchies in Late Imperial and Republican China, under which advanced age and generational seniority were the primary determinants of sociopolitical status, allowed many poor but senior individuals to possess status and political authority highly disproportionate to their wealth. In comparison, landed wealth was a fairly strict prerequisite for high status and authority in the far more 'individualist' society of early modern England, essentially excluding low-income individuals from secular positions of prestige and leadership. Zhang argues that this social difference had major consequences for property institutions and agricultural production.",N/A,N/A,en
The Confucian Continuum,"['Douglas Clifford Smith', 'Douglas C.

The work furthers understanding and communication between two diverse cultures. The focus is on how another society is attempting to deal with issues in education currently being addressed in Western academic and political circles. Taiwan is a particularly good example for educators in the United States to study because the country is one of the most dynamic, fast changing and economically successful societies in the world, using the vehicle of education to assure social harmony and the self-actualization of its students and to prepare students for careers in business, science, government service and service-oriented careers. The team approach to each essay assures that no published research from either culture has been overlooked. Some of the research is field based; others use more traditional research methodology. Other societies can be viewed as laboratories where experiments in educational excellence are taking place and where Americans can learn how to better educate students. Schooling has many common elements worldwide--much education has been shaped by Western practices. In Taiwan the ethos shows a Western pattern of organization and a highly technological orientation side by side with traditional Chinese values. This laboratory lets us see how innovations and reforms work and how to spot pitfalls. Students in a variety of Education courses will benefit from these skillfully written articles. The Confucian Continuum demonstrates the successes that education has brought to the Chinese people of Taiwan and the problems that rapid modernization presents to the traditional education system.",N/A,N/A,en
