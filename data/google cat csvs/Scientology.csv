Among the Scientologists,['Donald A. Westbrook'],2019,['Biography & Autobiography'],"The Church of Scientology is one of the most recognizable American-born new religions, but perhaps the least understood. With academic and popular interest on the rise, many books have been written about Scientology and surely more will follow. Although academics have begun to pay more attention to Scientology, the subject has received remarkably little qualitative attention. Indeed, no work has systematically addressed such questions as: what do Scientologists themselves have to say about their religion's history, theology, and practices? How does Scientology act as a religion for them? What does ""lived religion"" look like for a Scientologist? This is not so much a book about the Church of Scientology, its leaders, or its controversies, as it is a compilation of narratives and histories based on the largely unheard or ignored perspectives of Scientologists themselves. Drawing on six years of interviews, fieldwork, and research conducted among members of the Church of Scientology, this groundbreaking work examines features of the new religion's history, theology, and praxis in ways that move discussion beyond apostate-driven and expos� accounts.",5,N/A,en
Self Analysis,['L. Ron Hubbard'],2008-02,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","The fact is, up to now the mysteries of the mind have not been fully understood and certainly not with any scientific precision. The fields of mental healing have been prone to ""best guesses"" while depression and anxiety still have no clear answer--until now. A simple, easy technique has been developed which allows you to address a range of undesirable emotions, reactions and attitudes toward life. It is by far the easiest and most enjoyable self betterment technique available and most importantly, it works. In fact, it was originally released in 1951 but is still relevant in today's modern age. Before you begin on your path of self discovery, it's important to gauge your current emotional condition. This next section will show you how. How to Measure Your Potential for Success Contrary to popular belief, your youthful and energetic attitude toward life never actually goes away. Rather, it is buried by the physical and emotional pain and stresses of your past. Each negative incident you run into through life will drive your emotional condition lower, and each success will move it up. When you have too much negativity and not enough success in your past, you wind up deeply depressed and unable to function in life. The events of the past have an affect on your present emotional state. By using the Self Analysis program, you will begin to remove this negative energy. Your outlook and happiness will grow as you unburden past emotional trauma and losses. You also gain a more positive attitude toward yourself and your abilities. Thus, you will get back in control of your life and future, instead of being stuck in the shadows of your past. With the Self Analysis program, there is a simple and effective technique that anyone can use to systematically relieve the negative emotional energy that has built up in your mind and rise up on the chart. The program is composed of self processing. What is Self Processing? The technique we are discussing here is not ""positive thinking,"" brain exercises, meditation or self-hypnosis. You may have tried some of these techniques before, and even achieved some benefit. But they do not get to the source of the problem--often the gains fade and you find yourself in the same place you started. It is possible to desensitize the harmful ""charge"" from incidents in your past. One way this is done is by moving your attention to pleasurable incidents by using the self processing technique below. Unlike positive affirmations or mantras, your concentration will be in recalling actual incidents in your past. It is remarkably simple to do yet quite powerful. In addition to discharging the negative emotional effects of the past, your personal abilities can also dramatically increase. Imagine being able to finally step out of the shadows of the past and into the vibrant light of the present with sharper senses and renewed vigor for life Begin the Adventure of Self Discovery How does one go about the self processing technique? The full regimen and instructions are contained in the book, Self Analysis by L. Ron Hubbard. L. Ron Hubbard began Self Analysis with these lines: ""Self Analysis cannot revive the dead. ""Self Analysis will not empty insane asylums or stop war. ... ""But Self Analysis will conduct you on the most interesting adventure in your life. The adventure of you."" Self Analysis has sold millions of copies in 50 languages across the globe. It starts with a series of short essays written in simple terms to get you to fully understand what it is, how it works and how to use the techniques in the book. Then, there are 12 target areas of your life that the processes cover which you will be able to",N/A,N/A,en
Blown for Good,['Marc Headley'],2010-03-31,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Marc Headley started working for the Scientology organization in 1989. After leaving in 2005, Marc posted bits and pieces of what went on at the Scientology headquarters (known from inside as the International Base). Marc posted anonymously under the screen name of Blownforgood aka BFG. In September 2008 Marc was invited to speak to an international conference of European government representatives regarding the Scientology organization and their abuses. It was at this time that Marc revealed his identity as Blownforgood. By 2009, the internet posts Marc had written over the years had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, but still there were people who questioned their validity. Stories of grown men being thrown into dirty lakes and pools as punishment? Physical abuse never reported to authorities? How could this happen in modern day America? Two years after Marc wrote about these things and posted them on the internet, a Pulitzer Prize winning U.S. newspaper printed accounts from former staff member who worked at the Int Base that matched and confirmed what Marc had written about.

One FBI agent described him as ""a mental case,"" but to his followers he is the man who ""solved the riddle of the human mind."" Urban details Scientology's decades-long war with the IRS, which ended with the church winning tax-exempt status as a religion; the rancorous cult wars of the 1970s and 1980s; as well as the latest challenges confronting Scientology, from attacks by the Internet group Anonymous to the church's efforts to suppress the online dissemination of its esoteric teachings.",5,N/A,en

The Way to Happiness,['La Fayette Ron Hubbard'],2007,['Religion'],"English Edition - SYNOPSIS: The choice of actions and decisions requires skill and wisdom, not just self-interest or just group interest. Containing 21 precepts, The Way to Happiness helps guide one in those choices encountered in life. This might be the first nonreligious moral code based wholly on common sense. FULL DESCRIPTION: True joy and happiness are valuable. If one does not survive, no joy and no happiness are obtainable. Trying to survive in a chaotic, dishonest and generally immoral society is difficult. Any individual or group seeks to obtain from life what pleasure and freedom from pain that they can.

I am sure you can think of instances of this actually happening. Such wrongs reduce ones survival and impair ones happiness. You are important to other people. You are listened to. You can influence others. The happiness or unhappiness of others you could name is important to you. Without too much trouble, using this book, you can help them survive and lead happier lives. While no one can guarantee that anyone else can be happy, their chances of survival and happiness can be improved. And with theirs, yours will be. It is in your power to point the way to a less dangerous and happier life.",N/A,N/A,en

Scientology,['L. Ron Hubbard'],2007,['Dianetics'],"Imagine an age where the predictability of science and the wisdom of religion combine. Scientology is called a spiritual technology for a reason. Scientology provides tools to assist you to find your own answers to your questions about existence, your own truth about your life and you. The word Scientology comes from: Scio (Latin) 'knowing, in the fullest sense of the word', logos (Greek) 'study of'. Thus Scientology means 'knowing how to know'. Although modern life seems to pose an infinitely complex array of problems, Scientology maintains that the solutions to those problems are basically simple and within every man's reach. Difficulties with communication and interpersonal relationships, nagging insecurities, self-doubt and despair each man innately possesses the potential to be free of these and many other concerns. This book was designated by L. Ron Hubbard as the Book One of Scientology. It gives the basic philosophical principles of Scientology, and shows practical application how to improve conditions in life. It covers concepts like the relation of mind body and spirit, it gives you the analysis of what understanding consists of and how understanding can be mended or achieved, and all other essential concepts of this amazing study, merging science and spirituality.",N/A,N/A,en

Having already mapped the unlimited potentials of a thetan in Scientology 8-8008, here is the culmination of Ron's next year of intensive research and development-working with auditor after auditor, preclear after preclear and delivering no less than 500 lectures-to make those potentials a reality. What resulted were no less than the Axioms of Scientology and auditing processes drawn from the very fabric of those revelations. Here, then, is the panoramic view of Scientology complete: the Auditor's Code, Code of Honor and Code of a Scientologist; a summary of Scientology and the Axioms; Intensive Procedure and the famed processes of Route 1 and Route 2-processes that literally make and break communication with the physical universe to undo Man's inverted belief that mechanics are superior to one's own considerations; and finally, the means to fully rehabilitate a being's innate abilities-as a thetan exterior.

'A flamethrower of a read' JOHN SWEENEY 'Candid and deeply felt' LAWRENCE WRIGHT 'Gripping and harrowing' LEAH REMINI 'Extraordinarily powerful' ALEX GIBNEY Mike Rinder's parents began taking him to their local Scientology centre when he was five years old. After high school, he signed a billion-year contract and was admitted into Scientology's elite inner circle, the Sea Organization. Brought to founder L. Ron Hubbard's yacht and promised training in Hubbard's most advanced techniques, Mike was instead put to work swabbing the decks. Still, Rinder bought into the doctrine that his personal comfort was secondary to the higher purpose of Hubbard's world-saving mission, swiftly rising through the ranks. In the 1980s, Rinder became Scientology's international spokesperson and the head of its powerful Office of Special Affairs. He helped negotiate Scientology's pivotal tax exemption from the IRS and engaged with the organization's prominent celebrity members, including Tom Cruise, Lisa Marie Presley, and John Travolta. Yet Rinder couldn't shake a nagging feeling that something was amiss-Hubbard's promises remained unfulfilled at his death, and his successor, David Miscavige, was a ruthless and vindictive man who did not hesitate to confine many top Scientologists, Mike among them, to a makeshift prison known as the Hole. In 2007, at the age of fifty-two, Rinder finally escaped Scientology. Overnight, he became one of the organization's biggest public enemies. He was followed, hacked, spied on, and tracked. But he refused to be intimidated and today helps people break free of Scientology. In A Billion Years, the dark, dystopian truth about Scientology is revealed as never before. Rinder offers insights into the religion that only someone of his former high rank could provide and tells a harrowing but fulfilling story of personal resilience.",N/A,N/A,en

The Dynamics of Existence,['L. Ron Hubbard'],1994,['Scientology'],"The Dynamics of Existence For millennia, Man has attempted to assess his place in this material world. How should he relate to the rest of life, and to his fellows? What are his true responsibilities, and to whom? There were no definitive answers--not from the ancient Greeks, nor from the materialist thinkers of recent times. And so it remained until L. Ron Hubbard realized his long sought-after goal: the discovery of a unifying principle that applied to all life, a common denominator by which all men and, indeed, all life, might be understood. From this came a flood of discoveries that cast new light on the nature of man and life. The principles in this booklet help one solve the ancient moral dilemma of right and wrong and bring about a new level of rationality. With them, one can align the various factors of existence, the right decisions when faced with choices and achieve a new perspective on the directions available in his life. Mr. Hubbard expanded upon these principles in many other writings and lectures.

Child X,['Jamie Mustard'],2025-07-29,['Biography & Autobiography'],"""Jamie Mustard was born into one of the most influential fringe movements in the 1970s: Scientology. Raised on a mythology of spaceships and made to believe that it was his life's purpose to help save the world, he was determined to survive--not only neglect but also the physical and psychological gauntlets of extreme poverty and illiteracy. A dark, existential journey, Child X takes readers through Jamie's childhood and adolescence in 'the movement, ' his escape, and his rise into self-possession. This book tells the unfathomable story of a lost generation of children who endured mass psychological indoctrination and captivity""-- Provided by publisher.",N/A,N/A,en

"What Is Scientology? History, Beliefs, Rules, Secrets and Facts",['Boyd Grant'],2014-08-14,[],"By now it's a safe bet that you have at least heard of Scientology. Nine times out of ten what you have heard is negative. Very rarely do you ever hear something positive about the Church of Scientology or Scientologists. This often leads to a greater misunderstanding of Scientology, Scientologists and what the mission of the Church of Scientology actually is. Scientology is arguably the most controversial of all the religions. When you mention Scientology to someone you are almost guaranteed to get some kind of reaction or opinion. The Church of Scientology has been maligned and demonized by many detractors. But Scientologists themselves are passionate about their beliefs and defend Scientology with that very same passion. When it finally comes down to understand what Scientology is there is little if any objective information out there. It's all written from the perspective of detractors, supporters or people who just uninformed about Scientology and Scientologists in general. A new book, What Is Scientology - History, Beliefs, Rules, Secrets and Facts, will help shed some light on one of the most controversial topics of all time, Scientology. Look no further for one of the few objective accounts that will finally shed some light on the Church of Scientology. What Is Scientology? History, Beliefs, Rules, Secrets and Facts helps you better understand Scientology. It cuts out all the unhelpful chatter and helps you understand in simple terms exactly what Scientology is. This short book will help answer the most important questions you might have about Scientology. Some of the more important questions include everything from the Scientology belief system, the History of Scientology, and why people join the Church of Scientology and much more. You will also have a greater understanding of why people hate Scientology and why former members speak out about it. For those of you looking to learn more about Scientology this is the book you are looking for.",N/A,N/A,en
The Church of Fear,['John Sweeney'],2013-01,['Scientology'],"Tom Cruise and John Travolta say the Church of Scientology is a force for good. Others disagree. Award-winning journalist John Sweeney investigated the Church for more than half a decade. During that time he was intimidated, spied on and followed and the results were spectacular: Sweeney lost his temper with the Church's spokesman on camera and his infamous 'exploding tomato' clip was seen by millions around the world. In THE CHURCH OF FEAR Sweeney tells the full story of his experiences for the first time and paints a devastating picture of this strange organisation, from former Scientologists who tell heartbreaking stories of families torn apart and lives ruined to its current followers who say it is the solution to many of mankind's problems. This is the real story of the Church by the reporter who was brave enough to take it on.",N/A,N/A,en
Bare-Faced Messiah,['Russell Miller'],2016-01-07,[],"Bare-Faced Messiah tells the extraordinary story of L. Ron Hubbard, a penniless science-fi ction writer who founded the Church of Scientology, became a millionaire prophet and convinced his adoring followers that he alone could save the world. According to his 'official' biography, Hubbard was an explorer, engineer, scientist, war hero and philosopher. But in the words of a Californian judge, he was schizophrenic, paranoid and a pathological liar. What is not in dispute is that Hubbard was one of the most bizarre characters of the twentieth century. Bare-Faced Messiah exposes the myths surrounding the fascinating and mysterious founder of the Church of Scientology - a man of hypnotic charm and limitless imagination - and provides the defi nitive account of how the notorious organisation was created.",N/A,N/A,en
