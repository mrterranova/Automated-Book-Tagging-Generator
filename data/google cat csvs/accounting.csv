This book aims to contribute to the accounting literature at two levels. First, it aims to explore the role of accounting technologies in constructing and underpinning order. Second, it seeks to develop a better understanding of accounting practice in the ancient world, drawing in particular on the case of ancient Egypt. The author provides a conceptual treatment of the notion of order and then draws on evidence from ancient Egypt to illustrate and articulate the notion of order and the roles of accounting technologies in constructing and underpinning order. Despite the voluminous literature on ancient Egypt, very little is known about accounting and control practices in this civilisation. This book fills a major gap in the market bringing together, analyses and theorises accounting inscriptions from the various historical episodes of ancient Egypt. A special feature of the book is to examine the role of accounting in constructing and sustaining political, social and economic order.

The Essays of Warren Buffett,['Warren Buffett'],2013,['Accounting'],"In the third edition of this international best seller, Lawrence Cunningham brings you the latest wisdom from Warren Buffett''s annual letters to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. New material addresses: the financial crisis and its continuing implications for investors, managers and society; the housing bubble at the bottom of that crisis; the debt and derivatives excesses that fueled the crisis and how to deal with them; controlling risk and protecting reputation in corporate governance; Berkshire''s acquisition and operation of Burlington Northern Santa Fe; the role of oversight in heavily regulated industries; investment possibilities today; and weaknesses of popular option valuation models. Some other material has been rearranged to deepen the themes and lessons that the collection has always produced: Buffett''s ""owner-related business principles"" are in the prologue as a separate subject and valuation and accounting topics are spread over four instead of two sections and reordered to sharpen their payoff.

International Financial Reporting and Analysis,"['David Alexander', 'Anne Britton', 'Ann Jorissen']",2003,['Accounting'],"This major new textbook is a development of the popular Financial Reporting by Alexander and Britton, and is designed to meet the rapidly emerging demand for coverage of international accounting standards (IASs) and the globalisation of accounting in advanced courses. It is predicated on an IAS framework but the European directives, especially as regards detailed formats having no direct equivalent in IASs, are discussed in detail. The European context and, in the case of important markets, the national context will be recognised and contrasted with the international approach. Important non-European influences, especially those from the US, will also be included in order to provide a genuinely wide-ranging appreciation of the implications of accounting internationalism. Part 1 - contains coverage of the theoretical underpinnings of financial reporting in an international context. It also describes the international, European and domestic regulatory framework of accounting. Part 2 - starts by analysing the legal background of the concept of capital and profit. The relevant parts of the second European directive are introduced and the contents of published financial statements described. The main problem areas of financial reporting as covered by IASs are then analysed. The approach in these chapters consists of discussion of each problem area and its theoretical issues, discussion of the international regulation relating to the problem, and important national and regional representations or variations. Part 3 - covers group accounts in an international context. Part 4 - discusses in depth the availability and transparency of financial information as published, and then the usage and interpretation of that information. The book is student oriented throughout, and contains activities, examples of reporting using IAS from real companiesÃ‚' accounts, questions and answers.",N/A,N/A,en

Document Raj,['Bhavani Raman'],2012-11-07,['Business & Economics'],"Historians of British colonial rule in India have noted both the place of military might and the imposition of new cultural categories in the making of Empire, but Bhavani Raman, in Document Raj, uncovers a lesser-known story of power: the power of bureaucracy. Drawing on extensive archival research in the files of the East India Company’s administrative offices in Madras, she tells the story of a bureaucracy gone awry in a fever of documentation practices that grew ever more abstract—and the power, both economic and cultural, this created. In order to assert its legitimacy and value within the British Empire, the East India Company was diligent about record keeping. Raman shows, however, that the sheer volume of their document production allowed colonial managers to subtly but substantively manipulate records for their own ends, increasingly drawing the real and the recorded further apart. While this administrative sleight of hand increased the company’s reach and power within the Empire, it also bolstered profoundly new orientations to language, writing, memory, and pedagogy for the officers and Indian subordinates involved. Immersed in a subterranean world of delinquent scribes, translators, village accountants, and entrepreneurial fixers, Document Raj maps the shifting boundaries of the legible and illegible, the legal and illegitimate, that would usher India into the modern world.",N/A,N/A,en

Business Research and Statistics,['J. George Frederick'],2009-02,['Accounting'],"This historic book may have numerous typos and missing text. Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1917 edition. Excerpt: ... (6) Columns for Discount on Purchases and Discount on Notes on the same side of the Cash Book; (c) Columns for Discount on Sales and Cash Sales on the debit side of the Cash Book; (d) Departmental columns in the Sales Book and in the Purchase Book. Controlling Accounts.--The addition of special columns in books of original entry makes possible the keeping of Controlling Accounts. The most common examples of such accounts are Accounts Receivable account and Accounts Payable account. These summary accounts, respectively, displace individual customers' and creditors' accounts in the Ledger. The customers' accounts are then segregated in another book called the Sales Ledger or Customers' Ledger, while the creditors' accounts are kept in the Purchase or Creditors' Ledger. The original Ledger, now much reduced in size, is called the General Ledger. The Trial Balance now refers to the accounts in the General Ledger. It is evident that the task of taking a Trial Balance is greatly simplified because so many fewer accounts are involved. A Schedule of Accounts Receivable is then prepared, consisting of the balances found in the Sales Ledger, and its total must agree with the balance of the Accounts Receivable account shown in the Trial Balance. A similar Schedule of Accounts Payable, made up of all the balances in the Purchase Ledger, is prepared, and it must agree with the balance of the Accounts Payable account of the General Ledger."" The Balance Sheet.--In the more elementary part of the text, the student learned how to prepare a Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the purpose of disclosing the net capital of an enterprise. In the present chapter he was shown how to prepare a similar statement, the Balance Sheet. For all practical...",N/A,N/A,en
