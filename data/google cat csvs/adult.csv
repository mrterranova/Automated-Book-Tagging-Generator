Adult Neurogenesis and Neural Stem Cells in Mammals,['Philippe Taupin'],2006,['Medical'],"This title contains a book and CD. The brain has a number of nerve cells estimated at a magnitude of 10 to 100 billion, and 1014 to 1015 synapses, and therefore is the most complex organ of the human body. During fetal development the foundations of the brain are laid as billions of neurons form appropriate connections and patterns. In the adult mammalian brain, most neurons are post-mitotic, and therefore at risk for irreversible damage. As we age, atrophy of the brain occurs. As brain weight declines the volume of the brain in the 8th decade is reduced by 6 per cent -10 per cent versus the third decade, and neuronal loss occurs, up to 10,000 to 100,000 neurons are lost per day, though this estimation is being revised downward with the advance of more sophisticated measurements.",N/A,N/A

Developmental models of PTSD are necessary to fully understand the complex constellation of responses to trauma across the lifespan. Such models can inform study designs and lead to novel, developmentally-appropriate interventions. To this end, this book is organized in such a way as to present and integrate research into child, adult, and older adult trauma samples in an attempt to culminate in a testable model of PTSD risk and resilience across the lifespan. Each author incorporates a developmental slant to their individual chapter, and the chapters are organized to highlight potential differences in our understanding of risk and resiliency between children and adults. Initial chapters concerning pre- and peri-traumatic risk factors for PTSD lead into chapters reviewing specific risk and resilience factors in adults and children. Additional chapters focus on the impact of childhood trauma on adult functioning and the biology of PTSD in children, adults, and older adults. As PTSD rarely occurs in a 'pure' form, specific chapters focus on the impact of comorbid disorders in our understanding of PTSD, and the final chapters consider both psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for PTSD in children and adults.",N/A,N/A
Psychological Assessment of Adult Posttraumatic States,"['Erin Eadie', 'John Briere']",2025,['Medical'],"This book presents a detailed yet practical summary of the major issues and instruments involved in the assessment of posttraumatic disturbances. Drs. Eadie and Briere analyze the types of traumas most likely to produce long-term difficulties, and explain the biological, historical, social, and cultural factors that mediate between trauma and long-term outcome. This fully-updated new edition combines extensive research on traumatic events, including rape, stalking, sex trafficking, torture, terrorist attacks, motor vehicle accidents, and natural disasters, along with new material on complex traumas, parental disattunement and emotional neglect, drug-facilitated sexual assault, sex trafficking, pregnancy loss, COVID-19-related stressors, and exposure to social maltreatment.

Reclaiming Lives from Sexual Violence,"['Tim Donovan', 'Dale Johns']",2022,[],"This book takes an innovative approach to using narrative therapy in counselling people who have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Reclaiming Lives from Sexual Violence presents an illustrative case study of the authors, Tim the therapist in consultation with Dale the client, who was sexually abused as a child by a clergy member. The book is unique in documenting their therapeutic work using transcripts taken directly from their sessions together. This narrative approach invites the reader to consider different ways of engaging in therapy in order to challenge the dominant social discourses around masculinity and shame. Looking at shame from a position of value awareness rather than a deficit perspective, this book extends counselling to consider the individual experience as political and one that must be shared outside the one-to-one therapy environment. This will be an essential resource for beginning or established therapists and practitioners working with clients who have been victims of sexual violence.",N/A,N/A
Attachment Theory in Adult Mental Health,"['Adam N.

Bringing together the experience of a diverse range of mental health practitioners and researchers who routinely use attachment theory in their own work, Attachment Theory in Adult Mental Health provides a guide to using attachment theory in everyday practice. Adam N. Danquah and Katherine Berry present a wide-ranging and practical approach to the topic which includes studies on clinical practice, the provision of mental health services and accommodating intercultural perspectives. Section One covers the basics of attachment theory and practice. Section Two presents clinical problems and presentations including, among others, the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, psychosis, personality disorder and eating disorders. Section Three addresses the needs of specific populations, discussing the influence of sociocultural factors like gender, ethnicity and age. Finally, Section Four examines the organisation and the practitioner, including using the theory to organise services and how individual therapists can integrate their own attachment histories into their approach. Including the most up-to-date theories and practice in the field, Attachment Theory in Adult Mental Health is ideal for psychologists and psychological therapists, counsellors, psychiatrists, occupational therapists, social workers and mental health service managers and commissioners.",N/A,N/A

Freud,"['René Major', 'Chantal Talagrand']",2017-06-30,['Adolescent'],"This is a revised edition of an important title originally published in 2009. It is written primarily for psychotherapists and other practitioners and describes a new and effective form of dynamic therapy designed for working with adults and with adolescents. The theory, on which the new form of therapy is based, is centred in a paradigm that extends and crucially alters the paradigm for developmental psychology opened by the Bowlby/Ainsworth attachment theory. It describes a pre-programmed process, the dynamics sustaining attachment and interest sharing, which is activated as soon as people perceive that they are in danger. This process is made up of seven pre-programmed systems which interact with one another as an integrated whole. They include Bowlby's two complementary goal-corrected behavioural systems: attachment (also referred to as careseeking) and caregiving. Whenever the process is able to function effectively, it enables people to adapt more constructively and co-operatively to changing circumstances.",N/A,N/A

Psychoanalytic Work with Autistic Features in Adults,['Laura Tremelloni'],2018,['Adulthood'],"Psychoanalytic Work with Autistic Features in Adults deals with the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties of working with patients with autistic residuals, formed in early life experiences that have remained dormant in the unconscious mind. Laura Tremelloni traces the process of identifying them in adult patients, and stresses the need to develop a treatment plan suitable for this kind of pathology. This book uses clinical cases to examine the difficulties of work with hard to reach adults with 'gaps' in their sense of Self and symptoms related to primitive experiences of ""non-being"". Tremelloni presents new, adaptive therapeutic intervention methods for overcoming such obstacles and identifies the personification and permanence of undeveloped parts of the Self, in hard to reach adults who have otherwise developed satisfactorily and would not be diagnosed as autistic. In such cases, the author suggests the need for clinicians to adapt classic psychoanalytic approaches to the alternating levels of development of the separate parts which the Self has broken into. Psychoanalytic Work with Autistic Features in Adults will help clinicians in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy to more effectively reach such patients, whilst attempting to address the problematic limitations of therapeutic techniques in very difficult clinical cases.",N/A,N/A
A Blueprint for Improving the Promotion and Delivery of Adult Vaccination in the United States,['Katherine M. Harris'],2012-01-01,['Health attitudes'],"Vaccine-preventable disease continues to take a heavy toll on adults despite the widespread availability of effective vaccines. This report identifies where efforts to improve the delivery of adult vaccination have stalled and recommends targeted strategies that are supported by available evidence and build on existing infrastructure. The authors conducted a comprehensive review of the published literature on adult immunization, a stakeholder workshop, and follow-up interviews with meeting participants and additional experts. They also partnered with an organization represented at the workshop to conduct a telephone survey of adults to learn about the relationship between influenza vaccination and beliefs about the safety of influenza vaccine. Findings include that office-based providers remain the primary source of vaccination, though a substantial proportion of physicians who treat adults appear not to vaccinate at all and adult vaccination is infrequently discussed at health care encounters. Adult practices also lack a strong business case to offer vaccination, as it entails substantial fixed costs. In addition, achieving substantial increases in adult vaccination will require persuading large numbers of individuals disinclined to be vaccinated. Vaccination stakeholders need to engage in a collaborative fashion to promote adult vaccination and the integration of advice about vaccination into routine office-based practice. Recommendations include strengthening evidence surrounding practice gaps and the economic value of promoting vaccination in office-based settings, improving guidance to providers about vaccinating adults, and formalizing procedures for referring patients to complementary vaccinators.",N/A,N/A

Discourse Analysis in Adults with and Without Communication Disorders,"['Carl Coelho', 'Leora Cherney', 'Barbara Bennett Shadden']",2022-07-29,['Aging'],"Discourse Analysis in Adults With and Without Communication Disorders: A Resource for Clinicians and Researchers provides state-of-the-art information about discourse analysis with sections on Aging, Aphasia, Cognitive Communication Disorders, and Neurodegenerative Diseases. The three renowned editors are actively engaged in the area of discourse. Expert clinical researchers introduce and organize each section, and chapters are authored by leaders involved in discourse research worldwide. Discourse is considered the most natural unit of language. There are several types of discourse, such as narrative, procedural, descriptive, persuasive, and conversational. Each serves a specific function and has different characteristics. The speaker's intent and the communicative situation determine the type of discourse we use. Effective production of discourse requires complex interactions among linguistic, cognitive, and social abilities that are sensitive to even mild disruption in any one of these elements. This book covers the examination of discourse in adults with acquired communication disorders, including selecting elicitation tasks, streamlining transcription processes, expanding analysis methods, and translating findings for treatment application. Key Features: Provides a global perspective on discourse assessment for clinicians. Dedicated chapters on Aging, Aphasia, Cognitive Communication Disorders, and Neurodegenerative Disorders.

National and Local Antibiotic Prescribing Trends and Prescribing Appropriateness in Older Adults,['Fawaz M. Alotaibi'],2019,['Adult'],"Background: Antibiotic overuse/misuse has been documented in several reports to increase the risk of Clostridioides difficile (C.diff) infection and antibiotic resistance. The older adult population is more prone to use antibiotic medications than any other age group due to decreased immune function, use of urinary catheters, ventilation during hospitalization and other factors. Antibiotic resistance and C.diff are major public health problems. However, studies examining the trends of antibiotic use and the association between the antibiotic use and negative health outcomes among older adults in the outpatient and emergency department settings are limited. Objectives: The main objectives of this dissertation were to: 1) calculate the national antibiotic trends among community-dwelling older adults in the United State; 2) evaluate the antibiotic trends and antibiotic appropriateness among older adult patients visiting the geriatrics clinic and adult internal ambulatory care clinic at VCU Health; and 3) examine the antibiotic trends and antibiotic appropriateness among older adult patients and middle-aged patients visiting the emergency department at VCU Health. Methods: For the first objective, data were obtained from Medical Expenditure Panel survey (MEPS) a nationally representative dataset (2011-2015). Descriptive analyses were conducted and multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the association between the antibiotic use and demographic and sociodemographic characteristics. In the second objective, data were obtained from VCU Health outpatient clinics (geriatrics, and Internal medicine ambulatory care clinic only). Descriptive statistics were calculated and multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the association between antibiotic appropriateness and type of clinics and other demographic characteristics. In the third objective, the emergency department electronic medical records at VCU were used. Trend analysis was performed across the dissertation studies using the Cochran's Armitage test. All variables were considered statistically significant at an Îł level of 0.05. All the statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Analysis Software Version 9.4 (SAS v.9.4), (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Results: There were 105,762,134 prescriptions dispensed to older adults in the outpatient setting in the US from 2011 to 2015. Antibiotic prescriptions were more common among women (18%) compared to men (12%). White participants received more antibiotics (27%) than African Americans (1.77%) and others (1.4%). Among the 3,515 patients who visited either Geriatrics or Internal Medicine ambulatory clinic at VCU Health from 2012-2017, 1,534 antibiotics were prescribed. Potentially inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions were similar between the two clinics (30% in Geriatrics clinic and 28% in Internal Medicine ambulatory clinic) with p-value of 0.08. In addition, 6,343 middle-aged or older adult patients were dispensed and prescribed an antibiotic in the ED at VCU Health from (2012 to 2017). Eighteen percent of the antibiotic prescriptions received by middle age group were considered potentially inappropriate, compared to 9% among the older adult patient (p",N/A,N/A
