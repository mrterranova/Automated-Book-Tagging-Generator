Weapons of the Weak,['James C. Scott'],1985-01-01,['Political Science'],"Weapons of the Weak is an ethnography by James C. Scott that studies the effects of the Green Revolution in rural Malaysia. One of the main objectives of the study is to make an argument that the Marxian and Gramscian ideas of false consciousness and hegemony are incorrect. He develops this conclusion throughout the book, through the different scenarios and characters that come up during his time of fieldwork in the village. This publication, based on 2 years of fieldwork (1978-1980), focuses on the local class relations in a small rice farming community of 70 households in the main paddy-growing area of Kedah in Malaysia. Introduction of the Green Revolution in 1976 eliminated 2/3 of the wage-earning opportunities for smallholders and landless laborers. The main ensuing class struggle is analyzed being the ideological struggle in the village and the practice of resistance itself consisting of: foot-dragging, dissimulation, desertion, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance and sabotage acts. Rich and poor are engaged in an unremitting if silent struggle to define changes in land tenure, mechanization and employment to advance their own interests, and to use values that they share to control the distribution of status, land, work and grain.",N/A,N/A,en

Ultra-High-Temperature Processing of Milk and Milk Products,['H. Burton'],2012-12-06,['Technology & Engineering'],"This book attempts to explain the scientific basis for UHT sterilization and aseptic filling, as well as describe the processes and equipment used. I have tried to avoid producing merely a catalogue of sterilizers and aseptic fillers. Instead I have attempted to explain the principles on which the different types of plant operate, and discuss the factors which influence performance, so that information given by manufac turers may be assessed by readers in relation to their own processing requirements. Statements are generally supported by references. Where no re ference is given, personal experience or my interpretation of the work of others is my justification. Although the book deals mainly with milk and milk products, I hope that the information it contains will be useful to those dealing with other products, since the principles of processing are in general the same. The book is based on more than 30 years' involvement with research into UHT processing and aseptic filling. During this time I have been fortunate to work with and to talk to many people from whom I have learned a great deal. I benefited from conta.cts with Dr T. R. Ashton (England) and Professor H. Hostettler. (Switzerland), who were pioneers in the commercial development of UHT milk. More recently I have been privileged to know and work with research workers in many countries having a common interest in UHT processing. Of these, I should mention particularly Professors E. L.

Biocommunication of Fungi,['Günther Witzany'],2012-05-31,['Science'],"Fungi are sessile, highly sensitive organisms that actively compete for environmental resources both above and below the ground. They assess their surroundings, estimate how much energy they need for particular goals, and then realise the optimum variant. They take measures to control certain environmental resources. They perceive themselves and can distinguish between ‘self’ and ‘non-self’. They process and evaluate information and then modify their behaviour accordingly. These highly diverse competences show us that this is possible owing to sign(aling)-mediated communication processes within fungal cells (intraorganismic), between the same, related and different fungal species (interorganismic), and between fungi and non-fungal organisms (transorganismic). Intraorganismic communication involves sign-mediated interactions within cells (intracellular) and between cells (intercellular). This is crucial in coordinating growth and development, shape and dynamics. Such communication mustfunction both on the local level and between widely separated mycelium parts. This allows fungi to coordinate appropriate response behaviors in a differentiated manner to their current developmental status and physiological influences.",N/A,N/A,en

The Changing Scale of American Agriculture,['John Fraser Hart'],2003,['Business & Economics'],"Few Americans know much about contemporary farming, which has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. In The Changing Scale of American Agriculture, the award-winning geographer and landscape historian John Fraser Hart describes the transformation of farming from the mid-twentieth century, when small family farms were still viable, to the present, when a farm must sell at least $250,000 of farm products each year to provide an acceptable level of living for a family. The increased scale of agriculture has outmoded the Jeffersonian ideal of small, self-sufficient farms. In the past farmers kept a variety of livestock and grew several crops, but modern family farms have become highly specialized in producing a single type of livestock or one or two crops. As farms have become larger and more specialized, their number has declined. Hart contends that modern family farms need to become integrated into tightly orchestrated food-supply chains in order to thrive, and these complex new organizations of large-scale production require managerial skills of the highest order. According to Hart, this trend is not only inevitable, but it is beneficial, because it produces the food American consumers want to buy at prices they can afford. Although Hart provides the statistics and clear analysis such a study requires, his book focuses on interviews with farmers: those who have shifted from mixed crop-and-livestock farming to cash-grain farming in the Midwest agricultural heartland; beef, dairy, chicken, egg, turkey, and hog producers around the periphery of the heartland; and specialty crop producers on the East and West Coasts. These invaluable case studies bring the reader into direct personal contact with the entrepreneurs who are changing American agriculture. Hart believes that modern large-scale farmers have been criticized unfairly, and The Changing Scale of American Agriculture, the result of decades of research, is his attempt to tell their side of the story.",N/A,N/A,en

"Eat, Cook, Grow","['Jaz Hee-jeong Choi', 'Marcus Foth', 'Greg Hearn']",2014-03-27,['Cooking'],"Tools, interfaces, methods, and practices that can help bring about a healthy, socially inclusive, and sustainable food future. Our contemporary concerns about food range from food security to agricultural sustainability to getting dinner on the table for family and friends. This book investigates food issues as they intersect with participatory Internet culture—blogs, wikis, online photo- and video-sharing platforms, and social networks—in efforts to bring about a healthy, socially inclusive, and sustainable food future. Focusing on our urban environments provisioned with digital and network capacities, and drawing on such “bottom-up” sociotechnical trends as DIY and open source, the chapters describe engagements with food and technology that engender (re-)creative interactions. In the first section, “Eat,” contributors discuss technology-aided approaches to sustainable dining, including digital communication between farmers and urban consumers and a “telematic” dinner party at which guests are present electronically. The chapters in “Cook” describe, among other things, “smart” chopping boards that encourage mindful eating and a website that supports urban wild fruit foraging. Finally, “Grow” connects human-computer interaction with achieving a secure, safe, and ethical food supply, offering chapters on the use of interactive technologies in urban agriculture, efforts to trace the provenance of food with a “Fair Tracing” tool, and other projects.

The major factors causing food scarcity are biotic and abiotic stresses such as plant pathogens, salinity, drought, flooding, nutrient deficiency or toxicity which substantially limit crop productivity world-wide. In this scenario, strategies should be adopted to achieve maximum productivity and economic crop returns. In this book we have mainly focused on physiological, biochemical, molecular and genetic bases of crop development and related approaches that can be used for crop improvement under environmental adversaries. In addition, the adverse effects of different biotic (diseases, pathogens etc.) and abiotic (salinity, drought, high temperatures, metals etc) stresses on crop development and the potential strategies to enhance crop productivity under stressful environments are also discussed.",N/A,N/A,en

Principles of Agronomy for Sustainable Agriculture,"['Francisco J.

The book first quantifies the components of the crop energy balance, i.e. the partitioning of net radiation, and their effect on the thermal environment of the canopy. The soil water balance and the quantification of its main component (evapotranspiration) are studied to determine the availability of water to rain fed crops and to calculate crop water requirements. Then it sets the limitations of crop production in relation to crop phenology, radiation interception and resource availability (e.g. nutrients). With that in mind the different agricultural techniques (sowing, tillage, irrigation, fertilization, harvest, application of pesticides, etc.) are analyzed with special emphasis in quantifying the inputs (sowing rates, fertilizer amounts, irrigation schedules, tillage plans) required for a given target yield under specific environmental conditions (soil & climate). For all techniques strategies are provided for improving the ratio productivity/resource use while ensuring sustainability. The book comes with online practical focusing on the key aspects of management in a crop rotation (collecting weather data, calculating productivity, sowing rates, irrigation programs, fertilizers rates etc).",N/A,N/A,en

Plant Structure: Function and Development,"['John A. Romberger', 'Zygmunt Hejnowicz', 'Jane F.

It is focused on the meaning of that anatomy, that integrated structure, as a determinant of effective function. A pervading theme is that the plant structures that have survived ""selection"" processes during the eons of organismal evolution, within the larger context of geo logic and climatic evolution, are well attuned to biochemical and biophysical principles that determine and define efficient function. The sets of structure-and-function couples existing in the various plant taxa differ so widely that generalities are often difficult to discern. This diversity is due partly to the broad range of ecological conditions to which higher plant organisms have become adapted under stresses imposed by competition and continual climatic change. It is also due to the tendency of different taxa, with their different complements of inherited information, to respond to similar situations in different ways. Cognizant of this reality, we have tried throughout the book to avoid generalizing too broadly on the basis of data from the relatively small fraction of plant species that have as yet been studied. This book is intended for those who have already studied the anatomy and develop ment of plants. It is addressed to advanced students, teachers, and researchers in the interrelated fields of botany, forestry, horticulture, and agronomy, and to others having professional interests in the culture of woody plants and the stewardship of ecosystems.",N/A,N/A,en

Phosphorus,"['Mikhail Butusov', 'Arne Jernelöv']",2013-03-26,['Science'],"​This book starts with depiction of the phosphorus role in life creation and evolution. Then it outlines in which vital processes different phosphates participate in life of all flora and fauna, from DNA molecules till body tissues. Crucial function of phosphates was noticed long ago, but only in XIX century discovery of mineral fertilizers made it possible to sustain the needs of growing global population, thus initiating a “green revolution”. Though, for many decades after it, the complexity of interactions “fertilizer-soil-plant roots” was underrated, causing massive damages, such as soil destruction and eutrophication of waters. Still, mining of exhausting natural phosphate reserves continued worldwide. Lessons of what happened in XIX century due to scarcity of phosphates were ignored. In the meantime, production of phosphates reached its peak few years ago. Immediate implementation of phosphate recycling technologies from municipal wastes can help avoid imminent global disaster.​",N/A,N/A,en

The Politics of Hunger,"['John W Warnock', 'Taylor & Francis Group']",2021-03,[],"Originally published in 1987. This important and provocative book explains the persistence of hunger, poverty, and the lack of balanced development in many countries and the central role of agriculture in economic development. Most theories of agricultural development are based on the experiences of western Europe and the United States while the two models for successful ""late development"" have been Japan and the Soviet Union. This book surveys the evolution of agriculture under colonialism in Latin America, Africa, and Asia and concludes that this long period distorted the development prospects for these areas and retarded the production of food. Under strong state capitalist governments, a few underdeveloped countries have broken the colonial patterns of development. However, other post-revolutionary societies are having far less success because of economic blockades and outside military intervention. While the primary focus of the book is on the short-run problems of inequality, the author examines the long-run ecological and resource constraints to a sustainable food system and raising the standard of living in the underdeveloped world.",N/A,N/A,en

Plant Microbe Symbiosis: Fundamentals and Advances,['Naveen Kumar Arora'],2013-08-27,['Science'],"Plant microbe interaction is a complex relationship that can have various beneficial impacts on both the communities. An urgent need of today’s world is to get high crop yields in an ecofriendly manner. Utilization of beneficial and multifaceted plant growth promoting (PGP) microorganisms can solve the problem of getting enhanced yields without disturbing the ecosystem thus leading to sustainability. For this to achieve understanding of the intricate details of how the beneficial microbes form associations with the host plant and sustain that for millions of years must be known. A holistic approach is required wherein the diversity of microbes associated with plant and the network of mechanisms by which they benefit the host must be studied and utilized. ‘Plant Microbe Symbiosis – Fundamentals and Advances’ provides a comprehensive understanding of positive interactions that occur between plant and microorganisms and their utilization in the fields. The book reviews the enormous diversity of plant associated microbes, the dialog between plant-microbes-microbes and mechanisms of action of PGP microbes. Utilization of PGPRs as nutrient providers, in combating phytopathogens and ameliorating the stressed and polluted soils is also explained. Importantly, the book also throws light on the unanswered questions and future direction of research in the field. It illustrates how the basic knowledge can be amalgamated with advanced technology to design the future bioformulations.",N/A,N/A,en

This study investigates the relationship between ethnicity and agricultural production at the household level, as well as the result of recent ethnic transformations in the restructuring of patterns of land access and social mobility within ethnically stratified communities. Ilahiane focuses specifically on the intensive farming systems of Morocco's Ziz Oasis, a 250 km long expanse watered by the Ziz River. Surrounded by Saharan desert, the valley houses a dense, rapidly grown, and ethnically diverse population of Arabs, Berbers, and Haratine (blacks).

CHAPTER VIII WHAT SHOULD THE NATION PRODUCE? From the standpoint of the farmer, the guiding principle in the organization of a farm is to seek the largest net profit; but there is another point of view than that of the farmer, and that is the point of view of the statesman. Since not only the farmer, but every one else, is interested in agriculture, the question arises, are the interests of the country as a whole best conserved when each farmer follows tenaciously his own selfinterest and succeeds in gaining the largest net profits in return for the effort which he expends in agricultural production? There may be, at certain points, a conflict between the narrower and the broader interests. In this case we are confronted with the problem of determining whether the individual or the general interest should be promoted. To the extent that the greatest good to the greatest number demands that the general or social interests be served, it falls within the domain of our subject to propose laws which will limit the free action of individuals in such a manner as to promote the highest interests of society as a whole. But while human welfare or the greatest good to the greatest number has long been recognized as the standard by which every law or custom should be accepted or rejected, this principle is so abstract that men may be fully agreed upon its acceptance as their scandard, and yet hold exactly opposite opinions as to the desirability of a particular measure. The statesman needs a more concrete standard which may be used with safety in his efforts to set proper limits to the free action of farmers and of those with whom they have economic relations, in the pursuance of their daily toils. Should the maximum in quantity of farm products be...",N/A,N/A,en
