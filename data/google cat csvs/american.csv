The Viking Discovery of America,"['Helge Ingstad', 'Anne Stine Ingstad']",2000,['History'],"Faced with harsh conditions in their Greenland home, a group of Vikings took the reins of fate into their own hands. With incredible luck, skill and fortitude, they discovered lands filled with a profusion of wood, wild game and fertile land. In the sagas that grew from this discovery, the lands were given names that resonated with hope and promise. Almost 1000 years later, a husband and wife team united their talents. Intrigued by allusions in the ancient sagas to fabled Vinland, they considered the scholarship on Viking culture and technology; they studied maps and they researched intensively the prominent theories on Vinland's location. And finally their efforts bore fruit when a remote Newfoundland peninsula yielded up a soapstone spindle-whorl, a Viking ring pin, and what had to be the overgrown remnants of over a dozen Viking buildings.",N/A,N/A

"Assessing Financing, Education, Management and Policy Context for Strategic Planning of Human Resources for Health",['Thomas J. Bossert'],2007-12-15,['Law'],This book contains a method for assessing the financial educational and management systems and policy context essential for strategic planning and policy-development for human resources for health. This tool has been developed as an evidence-based comprehensive diagnostic aid to inform policy-making in low and middle income countries in regards to human resources for health. It does so in three stages by assessing the current status of the health workforce and capacities for health workforce policy implementation with a particular focus on four aspects - finance education management and policy-making; by identifying priority requirements and actions based on the current status of the health workforce and by showing how to sequence policies and draw up a prioritized action plan for human resources for health. This tool is designed as an initial diagnostic instrument to be used in a process of developing a national strategic plan on human resources for health. It helps to provide a rapid initial assessment and a preliminary strategic plan as part of a longer-term and sustained process of human resources planning. It is not intended to assess the appropriateness of a workforce's skills mix or the technical quality of pre-service curricula which are the subjects of several other assessment tools. Rather it focuses on determining - and providing sequenced recommendations to improve upon- system capacities to increase the effectiveness of the health workforce.,N/A,N/A

A Cultural Citizen of the World,['Siegbert Salomon Prawer'],2009,['Literary Criticism'],"Based on an intensive study of the original German text of Freud's writings, letters and journals, S. S. Prawer's new book is the first to make a full and systematic map of Freud's use of English literature. The great psychoanalyst has long been acclaimed as a polymath, as a practical doctor who was also a theoretician, as a writer of non-fiction which was also a counterpoint to the great novels of the early twentieth century, and as an essayist who, like Montaigne, absorbed all of the cultural world around him. Freud was fascinated by writings from many nations and languages, and his use of English shows the great range of his reading: from Shakespeare to Bernard Shaw, Henry Fielding to George Eliot, Mark Twain to Thornton Wilder; from scientific works by Maxwell and Darwin to the economics of Adam Smith, Malthus and Keynes, and from psychology and anthropology to the origins of religion. Though Freud's genius was unique, his sense of being a citizen of a world far wider than Vienna was not, and it can tell us much about the exchange of ideas across national and linguistic frontiers. Though he was a reader par excellence, he was also a case study in how world literature can be used by men and women who are not professional literary scholars or critics -- and of how much it can come to mean to them, and for their sense of who they are.",N/A,N/A

The Prodigal Spy,['Joseph Kanon'],1999-01,['American'],"Walter Kotlar is the epitome of the American dream, the son of working class immigrants who attends Yale and becomes part of the establishment, but he is caught up in the '50s fear of the 'red menace' and forced to testify before the Committee on Un-American Activities. He seems a very unlikely Communist, but before the hearing is concluded he has disappeared - defected to the East - though not before the chief witness has committed 'suicide'. 19 years later his son, Nick, receivies a message that his father wants to see him in Prague. His first reaction is rejection and denial, but his memories and curiosity combined with a deep attraction for the messenger persuade him to risk the journey only a year after the Russian invasion. He discovers his father to be dying and eager to 'come home'. He learns too that the events preceding Walter's defection were not as simplistic as he'd thought, but before he can really work out what had happened his father is dead, probably murdered. Sure now that his father is more victim than villain, Nick knows he can only prove this in America, but he is stuck in a country where rules of evidence and justice are ignored and gertting out is not going to be straightforward ...",N/A,N/A

Beach Synchronization,['Len Blanchard'],2013-07,['Nature'],"The sixty poems collected in Beach Synchronization are set either on the ocean, or on the beach, or in transit to or from the beach or, finally, in the mind of the narrator when he is simply thinking about the beach and the ocean. The first person narrator of these poems is the poet. This suggests what is indeed fact, that the poet has spent a great deal of time enjoying the many beautiful beaches along the west central Florida coast. However, while the beach is often beautiful, anyone who has spent any time near or on the ocean knows marine weather can be harsh, even life-threatening. Indeed, the beach is an arena where dramas of life and death are played out daily. To truly appreciate the shore and the ocean, then, one must respect the marine environment and the lessons it has to teach us. One must, in other words, be in synch with the various moods of the sea and nature. The poems herein are loosely organized around the premise that the moods of the sea and marine weather have their various rhythms. An overarching theme of the poems is that one who is in tune with the rhythms of marine life will find himself or herself in communion with a transcendent reality. In other words, one who is synchronized to the natural world is likely to feel that the world of the senses is not the only world. In many of the poems in this collection, the narrator is overcome with a premonition or an inkling that the world he knows with his senses provides evidence of a higher reality, a reality in which the significance of his human experience - whatever it has been -- will become fully clear and will be justified.",N/A,N/A

Manila Men in the New World,['Floro L. Mercene'],2007,['Business & Economics'],"The Filipino diaspora is at least four hundred years old. For two-and-a-half centuries, Filipinos by the hundreds traveled yearly to Mexico and the Americas, with many electing to stay and find a new life. The chief means for migration was the Manila galleon that sailed between the Philippines and Mexico to carry on a lively trade in Asian goods in exchange for silver from the Americas and the trappings of civilization from the West. The end of the galleon trade in 1815 did not stop the exodus of Filipinos to foreign lands as they began to discover the lure of other exotic ports in Asia and Europe. This book attempts to answer the question often asked: What happened to those Filipinos who started the diaspora? The answers are important because they fill a gap in the long history of this adventurous race.",5,N/A

The Rupture Tense,['Jenny Xie'],2022-09-20,['Poetry'],"* FINALIST FOR THE 2022 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR POETRY * The astounding second collection by Jenny Xie, “a magician of perspective and scale” (The New Yorker) Shaped around moments of puncture and release, The Rupture Tense registers what leaks across the breached borders between past and future, background and foreground, silence and utterance. In polyphonic and formally restless sequences, Jenny Xie cracks open reverberant, vexed experiences of diasporic homecoming, intergenerational memory transfer, state-enforced amnesia, public secrecies, and the psychic fallout of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Across these poems, memory—historical, collective, personal—stains and erodes. Xie voices what remains irreducible in our complex entanglements with familial ties, language, capitalism, and the histories in which we find ourselves lodged. The Rupture Tense begins with poems provoked by the photography of Li Zhensheng, whose negatives, hidden under his floorboards to avoid government seizure, provide one of the few surviving visual archives of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and concludes with an aching elegy for the poet’s grandmother, who took her own life shortly after the end of the Revolution. This extraordinary collection records the aftershocks and long distances between those years and the present, echoing out toward the ongoing past and a trembling future.",N/A,N/A

Correspondence of Edward W. Bradley,['Edward Bradley'],1853,['American'],"Unpublished archive of North American gold miner Edward W. Bradley Jr in the Colony of Victoria. Ranging from 1853 to 1868, ten letters tell the account of his voyage to Victoria and subsequent mixed fortunes during his time on the gold fields. One letter addressed to his mother; nine addressed to his father. The contents of the letters focus on his financial hardships, and provide accounts of the high costs of mining in Western Victoria. Bradley spends fifteen years in Victoria with little success, proven with his confirmation of funds received from his father on several occasions. Towards the latter stage of his time in Victoria, Bradley's father accuses him of profligacy and being a ""spendthrift""; an accusation strongly denounced and countered by Bradley. Subsequent communication from his father vindicates Bradley's strong repudiation of the accusation, identifying ""Joshua"" as the ""spendthrift"". There is some indication of a rift between himself and his Brother, Daniel. The letters provide detailed descriptions of life on the diggings, including the death of two men on his own claim, and the substantial costs of living during this period. Bradley discusses disharmony amongst the miners and discusses the Bendigo Petition. Included in the archive is a one month Gold Licence issued to Bradley on 2 August 1853, as well as a directors' report for the Astley United Gold Mining Company upon which Bradley sat on the board.",N/A,N/A

The Miseducation of America,['Deborah Day Aikens'],2012-07,['Self-Help'],"This book challenges the consciousness of Americans as it relates to drugs and other addictive behaviors. Other sources have presented the incidence of said behaviors in a fragmented format, thereby fostering denial and condemnation of a few. In contrast the following material concisely connects seemingly unrelated realities which illuminate our destructive patterns which are insidiously destroying our spirits. Dr. Fernando Cabrera, New York City Councilman The hypocrisy of the American psyche will surely reap the seeds of their destruction. We condemn drug lords but at the same time stand by as pharmaceutical companies recruit unscrupulous doctors to peddle new drugs. Both prescribe by the profit motive: Business 101, supply and demand, the first one is always free; with little regard for safety or life. The tobacco industry, the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, kills more Americans than the sum total of all drugs. Our children are inundated with drug innuendoes through mediums of indoctrination such as music, movies, and the media. Our daughters and sons are inserting vodka soaked tampons into their vagina and rectum, and DWIs continue to soar at alarming rates, yet we deny that alcohol is a drug. Powder cocaine is glamorized and sniffing heroin is sheik, but if we smoke crack and shoot dope we are a crack head or a dope fiend. Condemnation of some equals the inevitable destruction of all. Miseducation: Like a Trojan horse it stands before us; consuming us, spewing invisible rays of destruction and death. We are at war America: It appears to be a war against drugs. In reality its a war not against, but for our spirits. We are loosing our ground because we have become disconnected from our inner strength. We are so comfortable with the immediate gratification of the here and now: we have become so allured by the anesthetization of the pain of our past and of our present, that we have resigned ourselves to self defeating behavior. America is plagued with a pandemic of addictive behaviors. The only way we will win the war is to reclaim our spirit and hold steady to our natural inclination of self preservation. The countless souls who are lost share a commonality in spirit and grace. There is No Such Thing as a ?ÇÿCrack Head or a ?ÇÿDope Fiend: only your mother, my father, his son, their daughter. We are all in some way interconnected. Our spirits bind us to a power greater than ourselves. Americans must get honest: We must take a stance. Enough is enough: Stop the madness. From this day forward our mantra will be, I will no longer allow the ill promises of drugs and other self defeating behaviors that allow me to transcend this place and time consume me. I reclaim my spirit; right here, right now.",N/A,N/A

The Liberal Record,['Marcelo Brazzi'],2019-05-25,[],"""A must-read, highly informative book. Marcelo Brazzi presents his ideas in a way that is both interesting and informative. The book is well researched and presents an overview of the track record of the two major parties. 5 stars"" (Maria Beltran, Readers' Favorite). Over the past few decades, the country has become highly divided politically. In the course of reporting current events, the concepts of conservative and liberal have become grossly distorted. At the top of a political agenda is the demonization of the opposition party. The true accomplishments and values have been suppressed. If this is not corrected, government will continue toward an abyss of dysfunction, disunity, and dissension. It is paramount that the US electorate is accurately and fully informed regarding the record of liberals and conservatives, hence this book. The author was a spacecraft engineer on NASA's Apollo program and a computer science instructor at California State University. He holds a master's degree in systems engineering from the University of California and has traveled extensively through Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. Among his accomplishments are ascending Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Everest and photographing total solar eclipses around the world. Living on the beach in Southern California, he is involved in managing his real estate investments, writing, and spending time with his grown children and his grandsons. http: //cyberia-quest.net/BucketList2017/BUCKET-LIST2017.htm",N/A,N/A

Florida Water,['Aja Monet'],2023-09-12,['Poetry'],"Inspired by the cleansing water often used in spiritual baths, Florida Water is an ode to the myriad ways a poem can rinse, reflect, reveal, and unravel us. An honest meditation on migrating to South Florida for love, connection, and community, these poems lay bare the challenging dance between the role of the artist, lover, and organizer. aja monet confronts the interpersonal truths of community organizing while also uncovering the state's fraught history with racial prejudice, maroon communities, and natural disasters. This intimate collection of lyrical poems are the artifacts of her search for belonging and healing as she wades through the rising tides of climate change, heartbreak, and systemic violence.",N/A,N/A

Freedom Never Dies - The Legacy of Harry T. Moore,[],2014,['African American'],"On Christmas night 1951, Harry T. Moore and his wife Harriette retired to bed in their white frame house tucked inside a small orange grove in Mims, Florida. Ten minutes later, a bomb shattered their house, their lives, and any notions that the South's post-war transition to racial equality would be a smooth one. Harry Moore died that night, his wife nine days later. Harry T. Moore paved the way for the '60s civil rights movement by championing equal pay for black teachers, organizing the black vote and publicly condemning racist attitudes and actions of local, state and national officials. Despite a massive FBI investigation and repeated inquisitions, the murders of Harry and Harriette Moore have never been solved.",N/A,N/A

Gloria (TCG Edition),['Branden Jacobs-Jenkins'],2020-08-18,['Business & Economics'],"""Gloria...is to the New York publishing business what David Mamet's Speed-the-Plow is to the Hollywood film industry."" -- New York Times ""A rare example of a contemporary play that keeps us constantly guessing where it's headed, Gloria is a work not to be easily forgotten."" --Hollywood Reporter With a sharp eye for the dark underbelly of human behavior, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' new play Gloria shrewdly depicts the declining, dog-eat-dog industry of publishing in New York City. As an unnamed magazine struggles with the world's encroaching descent into the digital age, the human relationships within simultaneously implode. Ani, Kendra, and Dean are the sparring, sharp-tongued assistant editors, constantly competing and complaining, vying over power and a better position. Governed by ferocious wit and corrosive dialogue, these characters spend most of the first act sniping at one another and finding ways to ignore their industry's impending doom...until, true to Jacobs-Jenkins fashion, the action is derailed by a shocking turn. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' plays include An Octoroon, Neighbors, Appropriate, and War. Gloria was named a finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. He is a playwright-in-residence at Signature Theatre. He received the 2014 Obie Award for Best New American Play for both An Octoroon and Appropriate, the 2015 Steinberg Playwrights Award, and the Windham-Campbell Literature Prize in 2016.
