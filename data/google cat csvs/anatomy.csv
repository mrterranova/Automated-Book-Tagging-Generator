The Human Central Nervous System,"['Rudolf Nieuwenhuys', 'Jan Voogd', 'Christiaan van Huijzen']",2007-12-31,['Science'],"The present edition of The Human Central Nervous System differs considerably from its predecessors. In previous editions, the text was essentially confined to a section dealing with the various functional systems of the brain. This section, which has been rewritten and updated, is now preceded by 15 newly written chapters, which introduce the pictorial material of the gross anatomy, the blood vessels and meninges and the microstructure of its various parts and deal with the development, topography and functional anatomy of the spinal cord, the brain stem and the cerebellum, the diencephalon and the telencephalon. Great pains have been taken to cover the most recent concepts and data. As suggested by the front cover, there is a focus on the evolutionary development of the human brain. Throughout the text numerous correlations with neuropathology and clinical n- rology have been made. After much thought, we decided to replace the full Latin terminology, cherished in all previous editions, with English and Anglicized Latin terms. It has been an emotional farewell from beautiful terms such as decussatio hipposideriformis W- nekinkii and pontes grisei caudatolenticulares. Not only the text, but also the p- torial material has been extended and brought into harmony with the present state of knowledge. More than 230 new illustrations have been added and many others have been revised. The number of macroscopical sections through the brain has been extended considerably. Together, these illustrations now comprise a complete and convenient atlas for interpreting neuroimaging studies.",4,N/A

Atlas of Human Anatomy,['S.

Neuroanatomy,['Adam Fisch'],2012-04-03,['Medical'],"If you can't draw it, you don't know it:"" that was the rule of the late neuroanatomist William DeMyer, MD. Yet books do not encourage us to draw and redraw neuroanatomy. This book teaches neuroanatomy through step-by-step instruction of how to draw neuroanatomical pathways and structures. Its instructive language is highly engaging. Users draw neuroanatomical structures and pathways in several steps so they are remembered and use mental and physical mnemonics to demonstrate difficult anatomical rotations and directional pathways. Many neuroanatomy textbooks are great references, but fail to provide a working knowledge of neuroanatomy, and many neuroanatomy handbooks provide bedside pearls, but are too concise to be fully satisfactory.

Updated introduction establishes the foundational understanding of systemic information and basic concepts essential to success from the classroom to the dissection lab. Revised comprehensive surface anatomy photographs ensure accurate, effective physical examination diagnoses with integrated natural views of unobstructed surface anatomy and illustrations superimposing anatomical structures with landmarks for more accurate physical examination. Insightfully rendered, anatomically accurate illustrations, combined with many photographs and medical images, strengthen comprehension of anatomical concepts and retention of ""mental images"" of anatomical structures. Bottom Line boxes provide detailed summaries at a glance and underscore the ""big-picture"" perspective. Illustrated tables clarify complex information about muscles, veins, arteries, nerves, and other structures for easy study and review.
