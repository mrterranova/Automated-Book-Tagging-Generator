The Animated Film Encyclopedia,['Graham Webb'],2000,['Performing Arts'],"Animated films often bring to mind images of Saturday morning cartoons on television, but at one time, animated films, both long and short, were found mostly on the silver screen as part of the featured program. In 1977, George Lucas even specially requested a cartoon to open Star Wars-""Duck Dodgers and the 241⁄2 Century,"" featuring Daffy Duck. In its rich history, cinematic animation has developed from silent monochrome images to sound-filled shorts that ran with newsreels and adventure serials-to animation sequences used to enliven commercials or live-action films-and finally to feature films like Fantasia and Cinderella. This encyclopedia covers all English language animation from the crucial first eighty years of its history. From the popular to the obscure, from Bugs to Mickey, from the short to the feature, nearly 7,000 items are covered. Each entry includes production information, date, running time, and a synopsis. Much of the information compiled here is rare. For example, character voices once considered ""anonymous"" are here identified, and animated films now lost because they were once considered expendable are here given the attention they deserve.

"VIRTOPSY--Scientific Documentation, Reconstruction and Animation in Forensic","['U. Buck', 'M. Braun', 'E. Aghayev', 'C. Jackowski', 'P. Vock', 'M. Sonnenschein', 'R. Dirnhofer']",2005,['3D Optical Scanning'],"Until today, most of the documentation of forensic relevant medical findings is limited to traditional 2D photography, 2D conventional radiographs, sketches and verbal description. There are still some limitations of the classic documentation in forensic science especially if a 3D documentation is necessary. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate new 3D real data based geo-metric technology approaches. This paper present approaches to a 3D geo-metric documentation of injuries on the body surface and internal injuries in the living and deceased cases. Using modern imaging methods such as photogrammetry, optical surface and radiological CT/MRI scanning in combination it could be demonstrated that a real, full 3D data based individual documentation of the body surface and internal structures is possible in a non-invasive and non-destructive manner. Using the data merging/fusing and animation possibilities, it is possible to answer reconstructive questions of the dynamic development of patterned injuries (morphologic imprints) and to evaluate the possibility, that they are matchable or linkable to suspected injury-causing instruments. For the first time, to our knowledge, the method of optical and radiological 3D scanning was used to document the forensic relevant injuries of human body in combination with vehicle damages. By this complementary documentation approach, individual forensic real data based analysis and animation were possible linking body injuries to vehicle deformations or damages. These data allow conclusions to be drawn for automobile accident research, optimization of vehicle safety (pedestrian and passenger) and for further development of crash dummies. Real 3D data based documentation opens a new horizon for scientific reconstruction and animation by bringing added value and a real quality improvement in forensic science.",N/A,N/A

The Animator's Motion Capture Guide,"['Matt Liverman', 'Matthew Liverman']",2004,['Business & Economics'],"Character motion is one of the most critical elements in creating a believable look for a video game, animated project, or movie special effect. Good character motion can quickly take the viewer into the imaginary world and help sell the scene, while bad character motion can just as quickly ruin the believability of a game or scene. Without a doubt, motion capture gives you the most realistic synthetic motion possible, and for this reason many companies use motion capture as the source for many of their animations. The Animator's Motion Capture Guide is written for all levels of animators, artists, project managers, and companies who wish to handle their motion capture effectively and efficiently. It is written from a motion coordinator's (lead animator's) point of view and gives a plan for handling motion capture, whether on a single project or multiple projects. It provides you with a complete, start-to-finish plan for dealing with motion capture, hints on selecting a motion capture service bureau, how to cut costs, and how to streamline your process. It also gives you a motion capture glossary and lists of motion capture service bureaus and performers. This book is a ""must-have"" for animators, managers, and video game companies who want to approach motion capture in a uniform, thorough, professional, and efficient manner.",N/A,N/A

Aesthetic 3D Lighting,['Lee Lanier'],2018,['Animation'],"Aesthetic 3D Lighting: History, Theory, and Application delves into the history, the theory, and the practical and aesthetic application of lighting in the fine arts and 3D animation. In this book, animation industry veteran and lighting expert Lee Lanier examines the importance of lighting and its ability to communicate information to the viewer. Lee examines the history of lighting as applied to the fine arts, film, photography, and 3D animation. He discusses the use of light color, light location and direction, and light shadow types to recreate specific locations and to generate moods. He includes guides for successful lighting in 3D animation. Software-agnostic examples lead you through useful 3D lighting set-ups. Chapter-long case studies step you through more complex 3D lighting projects in Autodesk Maya. An accompanying eResource (www.routledge.com/9781138737570) features 3D model files, scene files, and texture bitmaps, allowing you to practice the discussed techniques in Autodesk Maya and many other 3D programs. The lighting techniques covered in this book include: History of lighting as used in the fine arts The scientific mechanisms of light Light types and light application in 3D programs Light qualities including shadows variations Basic and advanced 3D lighting approaches 1-, 2-, 3-point, naturalistic, and stylistic lighting techniques Replication of real-world lighting scenarios and locations Overview of advanced 3D lighting and rendering systems",N/A,N/A
