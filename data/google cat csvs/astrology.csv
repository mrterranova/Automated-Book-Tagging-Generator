Christian Astrology,['William Lilly'],2005-03,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","Named ""Christian"" to avoid hassles (some things never change), this is the most famous, the most celebrated astrology book in the English language. It has been prized by students ever since its first publication in 1647. The Horary Astrology in these pages, in the hands of a master, is no mere parlour game. It is demanding and precise, combining science and art. Properly used, it will give answer to any well-defined question. William Lilly, famous throughout England for his almanacs & forecasts (he predicted London's Great Fire of 1666), lived during the English Civil War & was a minor historical figure in it. Into his studio came the rich and poor, nobles and commoners, with problems great and small. This new edition restores Lilly's original page layouts, with marginalia. Modern spelling throughout, this edition includes Lilly's bibliography, his original index & a new glossary. Also includes his original woodblock charts, and their modern versions. This is Lilly's great work as he himself knew it. In this volume: Book 1, An Introduction to Astrology, containing the use of an ephemeris; the erecting of a scheme of heaven; nature of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, of the planets; with a most easy introduction to the whole art of astrology. Book 2, The Resolution of All Manner of Questions, by a most methodical way, instructs the student how to judge or resolve all manner of questions contingent unto man, viz, of health, sickness, riches, marriage, preferment, journeys, etc. Some 35 questions inserted and judged.",N/A,N/A,en

A History of Western Astrology,['S. J. Tester'],1987,['Art'],"Superb general account.' Times Literary Supplement The story of the history of Western astrology begins with the philosophers of Greece in the 5th century BC. To the magic and stargazing of Egypt the Greeks added numerology, geometryand rational thought. The philosophy of Plato and later of the Stoics made astrology respectable, and by the time Ptolemy wrote his textbook the Tetrabiblos, in the second century AD, the main lines of astrological practice as it is known today had already been laid down. In future centuries astrology shifted to Islam only to return to the West in medieval times where it flourished until the shift of ideas during the Renaissance.",5,N/A,en
Ancient Astrology,['Julius Firmicus Maternus'],2005,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","Julius Firmicus Maternus, a native of Sicily, was a Roman lawyer of the senatorial class. He lived in the first half of the fourth century AD (c.280-c.360). He was also a student of Greek astrology, which forms the basis of this book. Of this book, James Herschel Holden writes, ""The Mathesis is the lengthiest astrological treatise that has come down to us from the classical period. It consists of eight books, of which the first forms an introductory essay on astrology, and the rest set forth the fundamentals of Greek astrology. Several sections contain material that is found nowhere else...."" (History of Horoscopic Astrology, pg. 66.) The translator writes, ""Magic, philosophy, science and theology combine in strange ways in the thinking of the last centuries of the Roman empire..... Firmicus seemed worthy of note for many reasons. He is almost alone as author of works produced both before and after an apparent conversion to Christianity.... He left a lengthy handbook detailing the astrological practices of his day, the only work which has come down to us in its entirety [90% complete: Holden] out of numerous astrological treatises written in the Hellenistic and Roman periods..... This manual was important because it was the channel for astrological lore to the Middle Ages and Renaissance.""

Saturn,['Liz Greene'],2011-08-01,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","Have you ever experienced the repeated delays, pressures, and disappointment associated with Saturn's transits and cycles? This classic astrology text, revered by both beginning and professional astrologers alike, offers a fresh perspective on how to handle the influence of this much-maligned astrological symbol. World-famous astrologer and Jungian analyst Liz Greene brings her unique psychological approach to Saturn, showing us how the frustrating experiences connected to this planet can be turned into opportunities for greater insight and meaning in our lives. Saturn, she says, symbolizes a psychic process--one that allows us to utilize the experience of pain for self-discovery and greater understanding. Greene traces the character of this most important planet through sign, house, aspect, synastry, and its role in mythology. She offers a brilliant analysis of Saturn to reveal the face of the ""Initiator"" who, for the price of our honesty, offers us greater consciousness, self-understanding, and, eventually, freedom.

The Planets Within,['Thomas Moore'],1990,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","The Planets Within asks us to return to antiquity with new eyes.

Chief among these masters of the interior life was Marsilio Ficino, presiding genius of the Florentine Academy, who taught that all things exist in soul and must be lived in its light. This study of Ficino broadens and deepens our understanding of psyche, for Ficino was a doctor of soul, and his insights teach us the care and nurture of soul. Moore takes as his guide Ficino's own fundamental tool--imagination. Respecting the integrity and autonomy of images, The Planets Within unfolds a poetics of soul in a kind of dialogue between the laconic remarks of Ficino and the need to give these remarks a life and context for our day.",4,N/A,en

Tetrabiblos,['Claudius Ptolemy'],2005-03,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","Claudius Ptolemy (c.100 - c.178 AD), of Alexandria, was one of the greatest philosopher/scientists of the ancient world. Among his books are the Almagest, Geography, Optics, Planispherium and Tetrabiblos. The earliest surviving version of Tetrabiblos is the paraphrase attributed to Proclus the Philosopher (412-485). Tetrabiblos (literally, ""four books"") was long thought to be a complete survey of Greek astrology. Recent research suggests this not to be the case, but Ptolemy's work remains the foundation of western astrology. In particular, his persuasive use of the Tropical Zodiac, rather than the Sidereal, changed western astrology forever. Book 1 of Tetrabiblos defines various technical terms and supplies other information needed by the astrologer. Chapters 9, 10 and 11 detail the influence of fixed stars in various constellations. Book 2 is the astrology of nations and their rulers. Books 3 & 4 are devoted to Natal Astrology. Book 3, chapter 2, explains Ptolemy's method of rectifying the Ascendant. Chapter 10 gives a method for determining life expectancy. Book 4 deals with wealth, rank, employment, marriage, children, death, etc. Published editions of Tetrabiblos traditionally include extracts from the Almagest (a compendium of Greek astronomy), as well as ""Ptolemy's Centiloquy,"" a list of aphorisms, the authorship of which is disputed. Many of the 100 deal with horary astrology. They have been studied by astrologers for centuries. Translations: Gardner (1911) lists four English translations of Tetrabiblos. The first was by John Walley, 1701. The second was Walley's translation, edited by Sibley and Brown, 1786, which is said to be worthless. The third, by James Wilson (author of the famous Dictionary of Astrology), was published in 1820. The fourth (this one, by far the best), was by J.M. Ashmand, 1822. A fifth translation was made in 1940 by F.E. Robbins. Of these several translators, only Ashmand could claim to be both a Greek and Latin scholar as well as an experienced astrologer. We are honored to present Ashmand's translation to a new generation of students. Ashmand's dedication is to Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), author of Waverly, an historical novel about the Scots rebellion of 1745. To Ptolemy's text, Ashmand adds his own preface, as well as a note on Mr. Ranger's Zodiacal Planisphere. Every serious astrologer, from the 3rd century to the present, has studied the Tetrabiblos. With the current revival of traditional astrology, it remains essential reading.",N/A,N/A,en

In Light on Life they have created a complete and thorough handbook that can be appreciated and understood by those with very little knowledge of astrology. Jyotish states that by considering the state of the cosmos when an event occurs, we can begin to understand its nature - and to prepare an appropriate response.

He was ill, but he had foreseen that. He had decided that rather than struggle with clients while sick, he would give himself a year to study, reflect, and write.

Seeing there is a three-fold World, Elementary, Celestiall, and Intellectual, and every inferior is governed by its superior, and receiveth the influence of the vertues thereof, so that the very original, and chief Worker of all doth by Angels, the Heavens, Stars, Elements, Animals, Plants, Metals, and Stones convey from himself the vertues of his Omnipotency upon us, for whose service he made, and created all these things: Wise men conceive it no way irrationall that it should be possible for us to ascend by the same degrees through each World, to the same very originall World it self, the Maker of all things, and first Cause, from whence all things are, and proceed; and also toenjoy not only these vertues, which are already in the more excellent kind of things, but also besides these, to draw new vertues from above. Hence it is that they seek after the vertues of the Elementary world, through the help of Physick, and Naturall Philosophy in the various mixtions of Naturall things, then of the Celestiall world in the Rayes, and influences thereof, according to the rules of Astrologers, and the doctrines of Mathematicians, joyning the Celestiall vertues to the former: Moreover, they ratifie and confirm all these with the powers of divers Intelligencies, through the sacred Ceremonies of Religions.

The Cycle of Growth,['Brian T. Baulsom'],2015,[],"""THE CYCLE OF GROWTH"" CONTAINS NEW CONCEPTS NOT FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE. The main principle of The Cycle of Growth is that all cyclic processes, no matter how many stages we split them into, are manifestations of the same Whole. When we compare the Cycle of Growth with seeming different areas of study there is remarkable correspondence. The book compares traditional philosophic and esoteric teachings with some of the latest discoveries in Psychology and Science - the most important being the discovery of the Transcendent Planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, the now accepted story of Evolution beginning with The Big Bang, the modern scientific use of Number Zero - which was not recognised in earlier history. We also considers insights given by the trance medium Edgar Cayce - who also gave verifiable information about people he never met. This also reconciles differences when authorities on a subject disagree. ASTROLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY *- Ancient philosophy did not include knowledge of the psychological concepts that are available to everyone today, although it was present in symbolic form. We also recognise that, as with the Hunter Gatherer, the mental psychology was different to that of today because the Jungian Thinking Function has developed from the general public access to Reading, Writing, and Mathematics - which are also relatively new subjects. *- It is becoming recognised that our experiences in the womb affect our later life. When we compare the Astrological Logarithmic Timescale of a human lifetime from Conception to Death with The ""Development of Personality"" stages of Freud, Erikson, and Piaget there is exact correspondence. *- The Logarithmic Timescale also adds a ""Transcendent Octave"" which gives rise to evolutionary development. *- The planet Uranus clearly relates to the Jungian psychological concept of The Individuation Process. *- Now in The Age of Aquarius, we can use recent historical discoveries to understand the other Zodiac Ages. THE TAROT *- The 22 symbols of the Major Arcana match the 12 Cycle of Growth Stages in sequence. NUMEROLOGY *- Traditional philosophical systems and Numerology do not include Number Zero because it is a relatively new discovery - only becoming a number in its own right in the Computer Age. *- The sequence of Numbers corresponds with the process of Evolution - and therefore The Cycle of Growth - from The Big Bang onwards, as demonstrated by the development of all Chemical Elements from basic Hydrogen. THE KABBALAH TREE OF LIFE *- This symbolic system gets closer to the archetypal universal principles than the others and therefore associates with all other areas of study to the enrichment of them all. *- The Astrological symbol of Neptune is a basic depiction of the 3 Pillars of The Tree of Life. With the discovery of Number Zero, we are now able to associate Numbers Zero to 9 with the 10 Sephiroth of The Tree - which was not previously possible. *- With the discovery of the Transcendent Planets we are able to add them to The Tree of Life where there were traditionally no planetary associations. *- ""The Lightning Flash"" of Kabbalist involution and related Astrological planets exactly matches those of the sequence of stages in The Cycle of Growth. We can now add a Transcendent function to The Tree which was not apparent before. THE BIBLE *- The Life of Jesus and the Genesis Story of Creation relate to our life in the womb and The Transcendent Octave of The Cycle of Growth. *- The 3 Octaves of The Cycle of Growth refer to the first 3 chapters of Genesis. *- The Tree of Life mentioned in Genesis and Revelation (and The Kabbalah) refers to the human Chakra System of energy centres in the human body, and the related hormone-producing endocrine glands.",N/A,N/A,en

Celestial Twins,['Elizabetha Levin'],2014-12,['Astrology'],"From the ancient days of the King Solomon to the modern times of Mark Twain’s romance The Prince and the Pauper, there were numerous legends and folk stories about entwined destinies of the people who shared the same date of birth. Many thinkers and astrologers have tried to explore this phenomenon, but there were no solid facts confirming these legends. Celestial Twins is the first evidence-based work that establishes the historical truth behind such myths, exploring 17 representative life stories. It begins as a tale of one curious observation of meaningful interconnectedness between life-paths of two historical personalities born on the same day of the same year. This accidental observation led to a systematic 15-year study of well-known celestial twins in which cases of such entwined life stories were detected and studied. This research led to the discovery of a new phenomenon—the Effect of Celestial Twins (ECT)—which demonstrates that though each human being is unique, there is fairly exact matching between the biographical data of celestial twins. All personages in these stories are well-known historical characters, such as Ernest Hemingway, Oscar Wilde, Nancy Astor, King George VI, Carl Gustav Jung, and Pablo Casals. Each of them was believed to have an unprecedented life path; and yet each person in these stories had a “twin” who had the same unique life task, used the same methods to complete it, and gained the same results.",N/A,N/A,en

Cardano's Cosmos,['Anthony Grafton'],1999,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Girolamo Cardano was an Italian doctor, natural philosopher, and mathematician who became a best-selling author in Renaissance Europe. He was also a leading astrologer of his day, whose predictions won him access to some of the most powerful people in sixteenth-century Europe. In Cardano's Cosmos, Anthony Grafton invites readers to follow this astrologer's extraordinary career and explore the art and discipline of astrology in the hands of a brilliant practitioner.Renaissance astrologers predicted everything from the course of the future of humankind to the risks of a single investment, or even the weather. They analyzed the bodies and characters of countless clients, from rulers to criminals, and enjoyed widespread respect and patronage. This book traces Cardano's contentious career from his first astrological pamphlet through his rise to high-level consulting and his remarkable autobiographical works. Delving into astrological principles and practices, Grafton shows how Cardano and his contemporaries adapted the ancient art for publication and marketing in a new era of print media and changing science. He maps the context of market and human forces that shaped Cardano's practicesâe""and the maneuvering that kept him at the top of a world rife with patronage, politics, and vengeful rivals.Cardano's astrology, argues Grafton, was a profoundly empirical and highly influential art, one that was integral to the attempts of sixteenth-century scholars to understand their universe and themselves.",N/A,N/A,en

Mundane Astrology: The Astrology of Nations and States,"['H. S. Green', 'Charles E. O. Carter', 'Raphael']",2005-03,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","Will there be peace? Will there be war? Find out with Mundane Astrology. Here, in one volume, are three classic books on the astrology of nations and states, by H.S. Green, Raphael, and C.E.O. Carter: H.S. Green organizes his book planet-by- planet. He tells what each planet will do in the 12 houses. Raphael organizes the topic by house. He tells how mundane houses work when planets are in them. In addition, both authors deal with solar and lunar eclipses, and earthquakes. Green shows the effects of eclipses in the houses, while Raphael describes them by decanate (100 sections of the zodiac). Both mention the effects of comets, although little about these mysterious bodies is known astrologically. Charles Carter, writing after WWII, discusses why astrologers failed to predict the war and what that means for mundane astrology. His plea for better data has largely been met, but the need for more study remains. All three authors give astrological rulerships for countries and cities. These are centuries old and are weighted to England and Europe. Carter's rulers are the most up-to-date. These are the essential texts for serious study of mundane astrology. About the Authors H.S. Green was an astrologer associated with Alan Leo's astrological revival back in the first decade of the 20th century. His various books are highly regarded (all but this one out of print, sadly), but biographical details are sketchy. Raphael was the pen-name of one Robert Cross, 1850-1923. He was the sixth in a series of astrological writers who used the name ""Raphael"" & remains the best known of them all. He wrote books on virtually all astrological topics. His book on mundane astrology dates from 1910. Charles E.O. Carter, 1887-1968, was one of the outstanding British astrologers of the 20th century. He succeeded Alan Leo as head of the Astrological Lodge of the Theosophical Society, a post he held from 1920 to 1952. He was editor of Astrology, The Astrologer's Quarterly, from 1926 to 1959. Carter's persistent genius reestablished astrology as a serious discipline in England, after two centuries of decline. He wrote his book on Mundane Astrology in reaction to the failure of astrologers to forecast WWII. In 1939, astrologers in London knew there was a full-scale war on in China, they knew the situation with Germany was tense, but they had studied the charts for the year, they knew the fuss would blow over. And they were wrong. Carter set out to discover why, his book was the result.",4.5,N/A,en

Astrology and Sex,['Vivian E. Robson'],2005-03,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","Synastry is the branch of astrology that tells us how we relate to other people. How Joe relates to Mary & what Mary may think of that. In this complete, classic guide to astrology & relationships, Robson goes far beyond the usual ""his planets vs: her planets."" He studies the overall weight of the two charts, the fertility of the inner planets, the condition of the 7th house. He compares her-planets-to- his-planets as well as his-houses-to-her-houses. Robson considers how strongly the individual wants relationships - and how many, whether he/she will marry early or late - or not at all, the likelihood of children, the possibility of divorce. He gives rules for wedding dates. In an extraordinary appendix, he lists some 266 classified rules & aphorisms, culled from many ancient sources.
