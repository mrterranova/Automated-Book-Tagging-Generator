"The Ace Of Soft Skills: Attitude, Communication And Etiquette For Success",['Gopalaswamy Ramesh'],2010-09,['Attitude'],"Our world is witnessing a major change in communication patterns, with expanding social spheres, openness in communication and professionals working in multicultural environments. It is crucial, therefore, that India's workforce remains world-class, through re-training and continuous improvement, to remain competent, competitive and successful. To create and nurture successful professionals, the acquisition, cultivation and fine-tuning of soft skills are highly essential in the given business paradigm. The ACE of Soft Skills is a part of this educational process that produces top-notch professionals. Divided into three parts-Attitude, Communication and Etiquette-this unique book provides a broad-based coverage of what constitute soft skills. The foundations of soft skills lie in a strong attitude; this attitude gets manifested as communication, which gets further refined as etiquette. This book covers a wide range of topics-a gamut of nearly 40 essential soft skills-including personal accountability, listening skills, business proposals, and the role of small talk and humour at work. The numerous case studies, cartoons, figures, tables and quotations not only offer an insightful, practical and well-rounded perspective into soft skills, but also make reading a joyful experience.",3.5,N/A

The Handbook of Attitudes,"['Dolores Albarracin', 'Blair T. Johnson']",2018-08-21,[],"Attitudes are evaluations of people, places, things, and ideas. They help us to navigate through a complex world. They provide guidance for decisions about which products to buy, how to travel to work, or where to go on vacation. They color our perceptions of others. Carefully crafted interventions can change attitudes and behavior. Yet, attitudes, beliefs, and behavior are often formed and changed in casual social exchanges. The mere perception that other people favor something, say, rich people, may be sufficient to make another person favor it. People's own actions also influence their attitudes, such that they adjust to be more supportive of the actions. People's belief systems even change to align with and support their preferences, which at its extreme is a form of denial for which people lack awareness. These two volumes provide authoritative, critical surveys of theory and research about attitudes, beliefs, persuasion, and behavior from key authors in these areas. The first volume covers theoretical notions about attitudes, the beliefs and behaviors to which they are linked, and the degree to which they are held outside of awareness. It also discusses motivational and cultural determinants of attitudes, influences of attitudes on behavior, and communication and persuasion. The second volume covers applications to measurement, behavior prediction, and interventions in the areas of cancer, HIV, substance use, diet, and exercise, as well as in politics, intergroup relations, aggression, migrations, advertising, accounting, education, and the environment.",N/A,N/A

Attitudes and Decisions,"['J. Richard Eiser', 'Joop van der Pligt']",2015-07-22,['Attitude'],"The concept of attitude has long been a central part of social psychological theories. It is important in other disciplines too, such as economics, business studies, politics and sociology. Originally published in 1988, the authors of this text show how attitudes and motives are crucial in human decision-making, and explore the relationship between them. They look closely at the real context of people's attitudes and behaviour, pointing out that attitudes are both a social product and an intrinsic part of social action. The authors show that theories of judgment, attitudes, attribution and decision-making can make important contributions to social issues such as the employment of nuclear energy, the storage of nuclear waste, health behaviour and medical decision-making. They emphasize that social psychology is relevant to a wide variety of social issues, deriving from the theoretical and distinctive methods that social psychology has developed.",N/A,N/A

Attitudes,"['Russell H. Fazio', 'Richard E.

How can we study and measure them scientifically? How are they formed and changed? Of what functional value, if any, are they? How do they come to influence our attention, perception, judgments, and behavior? These are among the questions that have spurred social psychological research on attitudes, and they are among the issues addressed in this volume. The articles reprinted in this collection represent noteworthy developments in the field's understanding of attitudes. Together, the readings provide a representative and broad coverage of the literature, illustrating well what the field has come to learn about the structure, function, and consequences of attitudes.",N/A,N/A
The Expression of Attitude,['J. Richard Eiser'],1987,['Medical'],"The Expression of Attitude deals with a number of broad but interrelated questions: what are attitudes, how do they relate to behavior, how are they acquired, and in what ways can they be shared? The author argues that consistency, within attitude structure and between attitudes and behavior, arises primarily from interpersonal rather than intrapersonal processes. Emphasis is placed on how people interpret behavior as an expression of attitude, and what they demand of such behavior before they treat it as decodable in a particular way.",N/A,N/A

The Cultural Career of Coolness,"['Ulla Haselstein', 'Irmela Hijiya-Kirschnereit', 'Catrin Gersdorf', 'Elena Giannoulis']",2013,['History'],"Cool is a word of American English that has been integrated into the vocabulary of numerous languages around the globe. Today it is a term most often used in advertising trendy commodities, or, more generally, in promoting urban lifestyles in our postmodern age. But what is the history of the term ""cool?"" When has coolness come to be associated with certain modes of contemporary self-fashioning? On what grounds do certain nations claim a privilege to be recognized as ""cool?"" These are some of the questions that served as a starting-point for a comparative cultural inquiry which brought together specialists from American Studies and Japanese Studies, but also from Classics, Philosophy and Sociology. The conceptual grid of the volume can be described as follows: (1) Coolness is a metaphorical term for affect-control. It is tied in with cultural discourses on the emotions and the norms of their public display, and with gendered cultural practices of subjectivity. (2) In the course of the cultural transformations of modernity, the term acquired new importance as a concept referring to practices of individual, ethnic, and national difference. (3) Depending on cultural context, coolness is defined in terms of aesthetic detachment and self-irony, of withdrawal, dissidence and even latent rebellion. (4) Coolness often carries undertones of ambivalence. The situational adequacy of cool behavior becomes an issue for contending ethical and aesthetic discourses since an ethical ideal of self-control and a strategy of performing self-control are inextricably intertwined. (5) In literature and film, coolness as a character trait is portrayed as a personal strength, as a lack of emotion, as an effect of trauma, as a mask for suffering or rage, as precious behavior, or as savvyness. This wide spectrum is significant: artistic productions offer valid insights into contradictions of cultural discourses on affect-control. (6) American and Japanese cultural productions show that twentieth-century notions of coolness hybridize different cultural traditions of affect-control.",N/A,N/A

The Psychology of Influence,"['Joop van der Pligt', 'Michael Vliek']",2017,['Business & Economics'],"Whether it's our choice of a new car or what we think about our neighbours, our opinions and attitudes are a way of negotiating the world around us. The Psychology of Influence explores how these preferences and behaviours are influenced and affected by the messages we receive in daily life. From consumer choices to political, lifestyle and financial decisions, the book examines how and why we may be influenced by a range of sources, from written text and television to social media and interpersonal communication. In a field that has fascinated scholars since Plato, the book addresses the key questions across cognitive, social and emotional domains: When do arguments become persuasive? What influence do role models have? What role do simple rules of thumb, social norms or emotions play? Which behaviours are difficult to influence, and why? Covering topics from attraction, prejudice and discrimination to reward, punishment and unconscious bias, The Psychology of Influence will be invaluable reading for students and researchers across a range of areas within applied and social psychology, as well as those in political science, communications, marketing and business and management.",N/A,N/A

Good Feelings,['Salman Akhtar'],2009,['Psychology'],"This tightly edited volume opens a new vista in psychoanalysis by focusing upon positive and life-enhancing emotions and attitudes. The realms it covers include love, friendship, enthusiasm, courage, tact, resilience, and forgiveness, among others. Seminal papers on these topics have existed but remain scattered throughout the psychoanalytic literature. This book brings them together in a harmonious gestalt. It is more than on anthology, however. Each paper is followed by a freshly written commentary that critically evaluates the paper and brings it in consonance with up-to-date, contemporary psychoanalytic knowledge. Issues of development, adaptation, psychopathology, and analytic technique, as these pertain to the positive dimension of affective experience, are elucidated. The book also deals with the broader and overarching issue of the 'goodness' that accompanies, causes, and is enhanced by the positive emotions in consideration here. Thus the ever-elusive and puzzling issue of psychoanalytic morality finds a place in the discourse, with all its rich and complex theoretical and technical implications. The fact that the contributors to this volume come from all around the globe (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Germany, Israel, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, and the United States) and represent a variety of psychoanalytic cultures adds flux and spice to the optimistic message of the text. Together the voices of these gifted psychoanalysts create an intelligent symphony of wisdom, listening to which is not only instructive to the mind but a joy to the senses as well.",N/A,N/A

"Stuttering Meets Sterotype, Stigma, and Discrimination",['Kenneth O. St. Louis'],2015,['Education'],"More than a century of research has sought to identify the causes of stuttering, describe its nature, and enhance its clinical treatment. By contrast, studies directly focused upon public and professional attitudes toward stuttering began in the 1970s. Recent work has taken this research to new levels, including the development of standard attitude measures; addressing the widely reported phenomena of teasing, bullying, and discrimination against people who stutter; and attempting to change public opinion toward stuttering to more accepting and sensitive levels. Stuttering Meets Stereotype, Stigma, and Discrimination: An Overview of Attitude Research is the only reference work to date devoted entirely to the topic of stuttering attitudes. It features comprehensive review chapters by St. Louis, Boyle and Blood, Gabel, Langevin, and Abdalla; an annotated bibliography by Hughes; and experimental studies by other seasoned and new researchers. The book leads the reader through a maze of research efforts, emerging with a clear understanding of the important issues involved and ideas of where to go next. Importantly, the evidence base for stuttering attitude research extends beyond research in this fluency disorder to such areas as mental illness, obesity, and race. Thus, although of interest primarily to those who work, interact, or otherwise deal with stuttering, the book has potential for increasing understanding, ameliorating negative attitudes, and informing research on any of a host of other stigmatized conditions.",N/A,N/A

The Asparagus Bunch,['Jessica Scott-Whyte'],2022,['Juvenile Fiction'],"A fresh and irreverent comedy starring a cast of neurodiverse characters - guaranteed to be one of the funniest novels you'll read this year. Leon John Crothers is 4779 days old (thirteen years and one month, if you're mathematically challenged). He has been 'moved on' from six different schools and most people think he has an attitude problem. Leon doesn't care for the label, in the same way that he doesn't care for Tim Burton, supermarket trolleys, train fanatics or Bounty bars. This time, however, things may turn out differently, as help comes from where he least expects it - Dr Snot, a physician at pains to help Leon navigate 'normal' and classmates, Tanya and Lawrence, who both face their own challenges. When school bully Glen Jenkins humiliates Leon in the school canteen and almost destroys Lawrence, Leon very reluctantly agrees to the formation of a club, The Asparagus Bunch. How Leon manages to navigate school woes and family drama - and astonishingly ends up with not one but two friends - is nothing short of a miracle, or maybe just simply down to being different.

The Effects of Simulation and Case Study Methods of Instruction on Undergraduate Nursing Students' Knowledge and Attitudes on Palliative Care,['Alice M. Myers'],2017,['Attitude'],"Nurses educated in palliative care are needed to care for an aging United States population. This exploratory pre- and post-test control group experiment compared two enhanced interventions (lecture with case study, lecture with simulation) and one control-group intervention (lecture only) to determine impacts on undergraduate nursing students' knowledge and attitudes about palliative care. Thirty-six (26%) out of 139 undergraduate nursing students in an urban university in the mid-Atlantic region participated. Subjects completed pre-intervention instruments, participated in the interventions, and then completed the post-intervention instruments. The three instruments were a subject information form (demographic information, non-academic palliative and end-of-life care experience), Palliative Care Quiz for Nurses (Ross, McDonald, & McGuinness, 1996) and Attitude Toward Care of the Dying Scale (Frommelt, 1991). The lecture and case study intervention applied experiential learning by having subjects read a patient's history and participate in an instructor-facilitated discussion about the patient's palliative care needs. The lecture and simulation intervention, conducted in an authentic learning environment, asked subjects to provide palliative care to a simulated patient. While both knowledge and attitude scores increased in all interventions, no group was significantly higher in analyses of post-intervention data. Within groups, the lecture with case study intervention had a significant impact on knowledge in the pre- to post-comparison. The lecture only intervention produced significant differences between the pre- and post-scores on the psychosocial knowledge subcategory. The lecture only intervention had a significant impact on subjects' attitudes in the pre to post comparison. The frequency of church attendance predicted philosophy and principles subcategory scores and was close to being a significant predictor of total knowledge scores. Experience providing palliative care in the clinical setting was a predictor for psychosocial scores. No demographic variables were predictors of attitude scores. Future research comparing case studies and simulation should incorporate authentic evaluation of clinical performance in addition to knowledge tests.",N/A,N/A

Participants were skiers over eleven years of age. They completed a questionnaire that investigated skill level, sources of motivation toward alpine skiing, attitude toward risktaking behavior, and risk-taking behavior. A MANOVA was performed to compare three groups of skiers: (1) 163 skiers caught on the slope while performing a voluntary thrill-seeking behavior that could directly or indirectly lead to a sequence of events frequently associated to injuries (RISK TAKING); (2) 190 injured skiers (INJURED); and (3) 219 randomly selected skiers (UNINJURED).

Planned Behavior,"['Christopher J. Armitage', 'Julie Christian']",2004,['Psychology'],"Psychologists regard the relationship between attitudes and behavior as a key to understanding human behavior. Here leading researchers discuss basic and applied issues relating to how human thought translates into action. The contributors focus on the theory of planned behavior, a model of attitude-behavior relations that takes into account not just attitudes, but also the influence of significant others around us, issues of personal agency, and motivation. The book begins with an overview of the theory of planned behavior, from the initial impetus to better understand attitude-behavior relations, through the theory of reasoned action, to the theory of planned behavior. Among the applied issues discussed in subsequent chapters are using the model to predict homeless persons' use of services, understanding the motivation underpinning suicide in an at-risk sample, and experimentally manipulating antecedents of risky driving behavior. More methodologically oriented chapters explore how the theory of planned behavior may be developed in the future. Several chapters discuss the potential integration of the theory of planned behavior with social identity theory and goal theory; other chapters discuss the key components of the theory of planned behavior and whether the theory might usefully be extended with the concept of descriptive norms. This book considers a full spectrum of important developments that enhance our understanding of the theory of planned behavior and efforts to extend it. From applications to new avenues for research, the chapters that make up this book address important issues surrounding theoretical and practical approaches to addressing problems in attitude-behavior research. Christopher J. Armitage is a senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the University of Sheffield, UK. His research interests focus on the relationships between attitudes and behaviors, and on behavior change. Julie Christian is a lecturer of social psychology in the School of Psychology at the University of Birmingham, UK. Her research interests include attitudes and inter-group processes, in particular how these variables relate to enhancing our understanding of behavioral outcomes.",N/A,N/A
