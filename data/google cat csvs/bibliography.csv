ABC for Book Collectors,['John Carter'],1995,['Antiques & Collectibles'],"John Carter's ABC for Book Collectors has long been established as the most enjoyable as well as the most informative reference book on the subject. Here, in over 450 alphabetical entries, ranging in length from a single line to several pages, may be found definition and analysis of the technical terms of book collecting and bibliography, interspersed with salutory comment on such subjects as auctions, condition, facsimiles and fakes, 'points', rarity, etc. This seventh edition, revised and with a new introduction by Nicolas Barker, editor of The Book Collector, incorporates additions and amendments which he has accumulated since the last edition was updated fourteen years ago. Nicolas Barker worked with his friend John Carter revising the ABC up to the latter's death in 1975 and has faithfully preserved the spirit of the original. The ABC thus retains its character as an indispensable guide to book collecting.",N/A,N/A
