Biology,"['Peter H. Raven', 'George Brooks Johnson']",1996-01-01,['Science'],"Take a New Look at Raven! ""BIOLOGY"" is an authoritative majors textbook focusing on evolution as a unifying theme. In revising the text, McGraw-Hill consulted with numerous users, noted experts and professors in the field. ""Biology"" is distinguished from other texts by its strong emphasis on natural selection and the evolutionary process that explains biodiversity. The new 8th edition continues that tradition and advances into modern biology by featuring the latest in cutting edge content reflective of the rapid advances in biology. That same modern perspective was brought into the completely new art program offering readers a dynamic, realistic, and accurate, visual program.

Greek Biology and Medicine,['Henry Osborn Taylor'],1922,['Biology'],"Thor is caught between titanic forces of good and evil, as Andronicus and Rafi use all of their dark sorcery to attempt to crush Thor's identity and take control of his very soul. Under their spell, Thor will have to battle a greater fight than he has ever known, as he struggles to cast off his father and free himself from their chains. Gwendolyn, with Alistair, Steffen and Aberthol, ventures deep into the Netherworld, on her quest to find Argon and free him from his magical trap. She sees him as the only hope to save Thor and to save the Ring, but the Netherworld is vast and treacherous, and even finding Argon may be a lost cause. Reece leads the Legion members as they embark on a near-impossible quest to do what has never been done before: to descend into the depths of the Canyon and find and retrieve the lost Sword. As they descend, they enter another world, filled with monsters and exotic races-all of them bent on keeping the Sword for their own purposes. Romulus, armed with his magical cloak, proceeds with his sinister plan to cross into the Ring and destroy the Shield; Kendrick, Erec, Bronson and Godfrey fight to free themselves from their betrayal; Tirus and Luanda learn what it means to be traitors and to serve Andronicus; Mycoples struggles to break free; and in a final, shocking twist, Alistair's secret is finally revealed.",N/A,N/A

Advances in Application of Stem Cells: From Bench to Clinics,['Firdos Alam Khan'],2021-09-14,['Medical'],"The field of stem cell biology is expanding with a continued surge of new information related to its applications. Over past few years, stem cells have been extensively used in cell therapy, tissue engineering, in vitro drug testing among others. At the moment there is no single book available which comprehensively describes the significance of various application of stem cells derived from embryonic and adult sources from lab to clinics. In this edited volume, we discuss basics and advanced topics of stem cells to help researchers, students and professional find the most important information in a single source of updated information about stem cells and relevant applications. This book is divided in 12 chapters and covers topics such as in vitro cell culture, 3D cell culture, cell therapy, tissue engineering, cell factory, cell functionality, in vitro drug testing, organ development, autologous transplantation, allogeneic transplantation, adult stem cells, multipotent stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, a pluripotent and embryonic stem cells.",N/A,N/A

Manual of Biological Markers of Disease,"['W.J. van Venrooij', 'Ravinder N. Maini']",2012-12-06,['Medical'],"A comprehensive reference work: This looseleaf work is an authoritative compilation of methods for the detection of autoantibodies (Section A: Methods of Autoantibody Detection); the structure, function, and molecular and biochemical concepts of autoantigens (Section B: Autoantigens); and the clinical significance of measuring autoantibodies in patients with rheumatic, connective tissue and autoimmune diseases (Section C: Clinical Significance of Autoantibodies). This unique work brings together all the molecular and medical information - very difficult to retrieve otherwise - in ONE publication. The Editors and contributors are leading experts in the immunological, molecular biological, and clinical fields. The format of this looseleaf publication allows regular updating of data as well as inclusion of new advances in research on autoimmunity. Until now, the work (Basic work including Supplement 1) included Section A, and the larger part of Section B, both in an attractive and robust ringbinder. Audience: By nature and design of this exciting reference work, it is especially aimed at scientists, including immunologists, pathologists and molecular biologists, and clinical chemists, as well as clinicians specializing in rheumatic diseases and autoimmune disorders, inflammation or clinical immunology. Supplement 2: This supplement primarily contains Section C (Clinical Significance of Autoantibodies). As in the other sections, the contents are presented in a consistently structured manner, beautifully illustrated with photos and schematic figures. Extensive literature references are provided. Also, this supplement includes an addition to Section B (Autoantigens), being chapter B.1.5: The Antigens Defined by Antikeratin Antibodies (AKA).",N/A,N/A

Extracellular ATP and adenosine as regulators of endothelial cell function,"['Evgenia Gerasimovskaya', 'Elzbieta Kaczmarek']",2010-04-26,['Science'],"Extracellular purines and pyrimidines (ATP, ADP, UTP and adenosine) are released into the extracellular milieu in response to a variety of stress conditions and act as important regulators of vascular homeostasis. This new book is uniquely focused on the signaling actions of extracellular purines in endothelial cells and the crucial role of extracellular purines in regulation of angiogenesis, vascular tone, cell permeability, wound healing, inflammation and cell-to-cell communication. This book examines the responses of endothelial cells, originating from various tissues (such as cornea, pancreas and uterus), to extracellular nucleotides and adenosine under physiological and pathological conditions, i.e. pregnancy, hypoxia, hypertension, inflammation and diabetes. In the book’s 12 chapters, the role of purinergic signaling in endothelium-dependent tissue perfusion, regulation of endothelial barrier function, and angiogenesis are discussed. The mechanisms of ATP release and its role in intercellular communication are also presented. In addition, the book provides the most up to date mechanisms of extracellular nucleotide metabolism by purine-converting ecto-enzymes and their contribution to purinergic signaling in endothelial cells originating from various vascular beds. This book is a valuable resource for biomedical research scientists, clinical scientists, graduate students and health science professionals interested in the mechanisms of extracellular purine function in endothelial cells under physiologic and pathologic conditions.",N/A,N/A
