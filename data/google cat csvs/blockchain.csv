Tokenizing college courses using the XRPL blockchain,['Angel Gutierrez'],2023,['Blockchain'],"In recent years, blockchain technology has gained significant attention from the education sector due to its potential to improve various aspects of the learning experience, such as the maintenance of records or ensuring accuracy. Blockchain technology can be used to streamline the verification process of these records as blocks are stored in chronological order, thus making it a simpler process to verify the origin of data. This study proposes a web-based technique that allows one to receive an NFT minted on the XRPL blockchain algorithm representing details of a college course they have completed. Such a solution and designed algorithm would allow students to not be bound by a school, and instead receive course NFTs from the desired institution. There are certain elements of the project that depend on industry adoption, so the proposed solution focuses on the reception of a token and how an institution could adopt the new technology.",N/A,N/A,en
