Master Builders of Byzantium,['Robert G.

Narrowing his focus to the masons, or master builders, he clarifies both their theoretical and their very practical concerns in architectural design, suggesting that the master builders relied on geometry and memory, rather than blueprints, to guide their work. The study focuses on churches built in the area of Constantinople between the ninth and fifteenth centuries, but it also refers back to earlier works such as Hagia Sophia, and it tracks Byzantine masons as far afield as Russia, the Balkans, and Jerusalem.",N/A,N/A

"Monuments, Power and Poverty in India",['A. S. Bhalla'],2020-03-19,['Architecture'],"Much has been written about the Imperial architecture of the Indian subcontinent, but this is the first book to dig deeply into the extent of imperial extravagance set against the economic and social conditions of ordinary subjects. Bhalla uses an extensive collection of illustrations to complement this apparent paradox, assessing three Indian empires – Hindu, Muslim and British. From the 3rd century BC through to the end of British colonialism, splendid and often deliberately ostentatious buildings glorified the contemporary social structures. Moving through these different periods, important symbols of the various empires are assessed, including the fort palaces of Agra, Delhi and Lahore and the Taj Mahal. The author here examines both the positives and negatives of empire, taking in social stability but also exploitation and oppression, exploring the subject of Indian poverty in a historical perspective alongside the more lasting symbols of empire. Through comparisons and contrasts, from the mausolea and palaces of the Mughals to the government buildings and memorials provided by the British, this is a comprehensive and well-researched overview of a country whose architectural history gives important insights into the diversity of its rulers. This unique look into colonial architecture and power dynamics will prove essential readers for students, researchers and all those with an interest in South Asian history or the history of architecture.",N/A,N/A

The authors discuss the drivers, challenges, determinants and benefits of effective M&E implementation together with the theories and models underpinning construction project M&E practices. Further, a comparative overview of M&E practices in developed and developing countries is presented to elucidate the best practices. The book first conceptualizes M&E as a five-factor model comprising stakeholder involvement, budgetary allocation and logistics, technical capacity and training, leadership, and communication. It then presents an M&E case study on the Ghanaian construction industry before expanding on the idea of M&E systems as an effective tool for project performance and in optimizing a project's contribution to society and the environment. The book further provides guidance on M&E practice for construction project managers, investors, professionals, researchers and other stakeholders and is therefore of interest to those in architecture, construction engineering, planning, project management and development studies.",N/A,N/A

This book places emphasis on the technical aspects of that architecture, following the process of building through each stage, from quarry to standing wall, from tree to roof timbers. The author examines the different techniques involved in building in brick and in stone and wood, and how these materials were obtained or manufactured. He also discusses interior decoration and looks at the practical aspects of water supply, heating and roads. Each type of building required special tools and these are described, using both surviving examples and modern parallels. The Romans constructed many spectacular feats of engineering, producing magnificent monuments such as the Pantheon and Pont du Gard. This book looks at these large-scale public buildings but also at more modest homes and shops.

Construction Safety Planning,['David V. MacCollum'],1995,['Technology & Engineering'],"Construction Safety Planning David V. MacCollum Construction Safety Planning is a comprehensive, practical, step-by-step guide for those who design and oversee large and small projects. Designed to facilitate compliance with new OSHA objectives, it presents, for those who are responsible for construction safety, what questions to ask in order to avoid conditions that invite injury or death on site. The book shows how to integrate safety planning into existing design and construction scheduling in order to avoid duplicating paperwork that is normally associated with safety planning. Advice is given on how to involve all supervisory personnel as hazard hunters, so that timely prevention measures can be taken. Author David V. MacCollum is a forty-five-year veteran safety engineer who participated in the development of safety planning concepts used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on big dam projects in the Pacific Northwest during the 1950s. In this clearly written reference he highlights the concepts and practices that reduced construction deaths by 75 percent and are today still enabling the Corps of Engineers to enjoy the same reduction nationwide, when compared to similar work not under its supervision-the end result being savings of several billion dollars each year.

Built,['Roma Agrawal'],2018,['Architecture'],"Imagine you woke up one morning to find everything created by engineers had disappeared. What would you see?No cars, no houses; no phones, bridges or roads. No tunnels under tidal rivers, no soaring skyscrapers. The impact that engineering has had on the human experience is undeniable, but it is also often invisible.In BUILT, structural engineer Roma Agrawal takes a unique look at how construction has evolved from the mud huts of our ancestors to skyscrapers of steel that reach hundreds of metres into the sky. She unearths how engineers have tunnelled through kilometres of solid mountains; how they've bridged across the widest and deepest of rivers, and tamed Nature's precious - and elusive - water resources. She tells vivid tales of the visionaries who created the groundbreaking materials in the Pantheon's record-holding concrete dome and the frame of the record-breaking Eiffel Tower. Through the lens of an engineer, Roma examines tragedies like the collapse of the Quebec Bridge, highlighting the precarious task of ensuring people's safety they hold at every step. With colourful stories of her life-long fascination with buildings - and her own hand-drawn illustrations - Roma reveals the extraordinary secret lives of structures.",N/A,N/A

The Project Manager's Checklist for Building Projects,['Mark Urizar'],2013-07,['Business & Economics'],"As today's building projects are becoming increasingly more complex, having an ever increasing number of requirements, it has become essential to comprehensively plan building projects upfront and determine how these can be effectively progressed and efficiently delivered. To do so, project managers must not only know and understand the different lifecycle phases and many processes involved, but must also be able to determine what the most appropriate delivery strategy for their particular project is. Establishing a project roadmap and having a comprehensive checklist of what to do has therefore, become essential, as these not only provide quick access to the necessary prompters that should be considered, but also enables the most appropriate decisions to be made. This book sets how building projects can be effectively delivered, it sets out the essential project management delivery processes through a roadmap of checklists that covers both the project and design management processes and lists their many associated activities, applicable to any building project. These not only provide a valuable insight as to how building projects should be progressed and managed, but also outlines what should be considered and actioned at any particular point on the project delivery path to ensure the successful delivery of viable built outcomes.",N/A,N/A

Developing a new transdisciplinary concept of 'sense of safety', this book argues that the whole person needs to be understood within their context and relationships, and explores the appraisal and coping systems that are part of health. Using clinical vignettes to illustrate her argument, Lynch draws on an understanding of attachment, and trauma-informed approaches to life story, and counsels against an over-reliance on symptom-based fragmentation of body and mind. Integrating literature from social determinants of health, psychology, psychotherapy, education and the social sciences with new research from the fields of immunology, endocrinology and neurology, this broad-ranging book is relevant to all those with an interest in person-centred healthcare, including academics and practitioners from medicine, nursing, mental health and public health""--",N/A,N/A

Although the structural detailing is typical of its period (1830), Prussian engineer and iron founder Karl Ludwig Althans used and varied the many architectural and engineering models at hand in a sophisticated and complex building with structural elements that can be read as advertisements, machine parts, religious forms, or simply as building elements. The foundry, which is still standing, is just one of the many projects Peters examines in this broad synthesis of nineteenth-century technological thought and methods of design that form the basis of the modern built world. Through such examples, he traces the growth of technological thinking as one of our culture's chief modes of thought and establishes its primacy over other forms such as scientific or humanistic thinking as the major component of building design.",N/A,N/A
