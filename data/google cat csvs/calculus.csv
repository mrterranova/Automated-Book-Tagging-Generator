A Course of Pure Mathematics Centenary Edition,['G. H. Hardy'],2008-03-13,['Mathematics'],"There are few textbooks of mathematics as well-known as Hardy's Pure Mathematics. Since its publication in 1908, this classic book has inspired successive generations of budding mathematicians at the beginning of their undergraduate courses. In its pages, Hardy combines the enthusiasm of the missionary with the rigour of the purist in his exposition of the fundamental ideas of the differential and integral calculus, of the properties of infinite series and of other topics involving the notion of limit. Celebrating 100 years in print with Cambridge, this edition includes a Foreword by T. W. Körner, describing the huge influence the book has had on the teaching and development of mathematics worldwide. Hardy's presentation of mathematical analysis is as valid today as when first written: students will find that his economical and energetic style of presentation is one that modern authors rarely come close to.",4.5,N/A,en

Numbers and Functions,['Victor H. Moll'],2012,['Mathematics'],"New mathematics often comes about by probing what is already known. Mathematicians will change the parameters in a familiar calculation or explore the essential ingredients of a classic proof. Almost magically, new ideas emerge from this process. This book examines elementary functions, such as those encountered in calculus courses, from this point of view of experimental mathematics. The focus is on exploring the connections between these functions and topics in number theory and combinatorics. There is also an emphasis throughout the book on how current mathematical software can be used to discover and interesting properties of these functions. The book provides a transition between elementary mathematics and more advanced topics, trying to make this transition as smooth as possible. Many topics occur in the book, but they are all part of a bigger picture of mathematics. By delving into a variety of them, the reader will develop this broad view. The large collection of problems is an essential part of the book. The problems vary from routine verifications of facts used in the text to the exploration of open questions.

The Calculus of Friendship,"['Steven Strogatz', 'Don Joffray']",2009-08-23,['Biography & Autobiography'],"The Calculus of Friendship is the story of an extraordinary connection between a teacher and a student, as chronicled through more than thirty years of letters between them. What makes their relationship unique is that it is based almost entirely on a shared love of calculus. For them, calculus is more than a branch of mathematics; it is a game they love playing together, a constant when all else is in flux. The teacher goes from the prime of his career to retirement, competes in whitewater kayaking at the international level, and loses a son. The student matures from high school math whiz to Ivy League professor, suffers the sudden death of a parent, and blunders into a marriage destined to fail. Yet through it all they take refuge in the haven of calculus--until a day comes when calculus is no longer enough. Like calculus itself, The Calculus of Friendship is an exploration of change. It's about the transformation that takes place in a student's heart, as he and his teacher reverse roles, as they age, as they are buffeted by life itself. Written by a renowned teacher and communicator of mathematics, The Calculus of Friendship is warm, intimate, and deeply moving. The most inspiring ideas of calculus, differential equations, and chaos theory are explained through metaphors, images, and anecdotes in a way that all readers will find beautiful, and even poignant. Math enthusiasts, from high school students to professionals, will delight in the offbeat problems and lucid explanations in the letters. For anyone whose life has been changed by a mentor, The Calculus of Friendship will be an unforgettable journey.",N/A,N/A,en

Calculus Reordered,['David M. Bressoud'],2021-05-04,['Mathematics'],"Calculus Reordered takes readers on a remarkable journey through hundreds of years to tell the story of how calculus grew to what we know today. David Bressoud explains why calculus is credited to Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz in the seventeenth century, and how its current structure is based on developments that arose in the nineteenth century. Bressoud argues that a pedagogy informed by the historical development of calculus presents a sounder way for students to learn this fascinating area of mathematics. Delving into calculus's birth in the Hellenistic Eastern Mediterranean--especially Syracuse in Sicily and Alexandria in Egypt--as well as India and the Islamic Middle East, Bressoud considers how calculus developed in response to essential questions emerging from engineering and astronomy. He looks at how Newton and Leibniz built their work on a flurry of activity that occurred throughout Europe, and how Italian philosophers such as Galileo Galilei played a particularly important role. In describing calculus's evolution, Bressoud reveals problems with the standard ordering of its curriculum: limits, differentiation, integration, and series. He contends instead that the historical order--which follows first integration as accumulation, then differentiation as ratios of change, series as sequences of partial sums, and finally limits as they arise from the algebra of inequalities--makes more sense in the classroom environment. Exploring the motivations behind calculus's discovery, Calculus Reordered highlights how this essential tool of mathematics came to be.",N/A,N/A,en

Baron'],1987,['Mathematics'],"Few among the numerous studies of calculus offer the detailed and fully documented historical perspective of this text, particularly in regard to the geometric techniques and methods developed prior to the work of Newton and Leibniz. Because the contributions of these and other mathematicians arose from a centuries-long struggle to investigate area, volume, tangent, and arc by purely geometric methods, the author begins by establishing background mathematical concepts. Dr. Baron provides an enlightening view of the Greek, Hindu, and Arabic sources that constituted the framework for the development of infinitesimal methods in the seventeenth century. Subsequent chapters offer an illuminating discussion of the arithmetization of integration methods, the role of investigation of special curves, concepts of tangent and arc, the composition of motions, and the developing link between differential and integral processes. Significant changes in proof structure and presentation are considered in relation to the formulation of rules for the construction of tangents and quadrature of curves.

Calculus for Biology and Medicine,['Claudia Neuhauser'],2000,['Juvenile Nonfiction'],"For a two-semester course in Calculus for Life Sciences. The first calculus text that adequately addresses the special needs of students in the biological sciences, this volume teaches calculus in the biology context without compromising the level of regular calculus. It is a essentially a calculus text, written so that a math professor without a biology background can teach from it successfully. The material is organized in the standard way and explains how the different concepts are logically related. Each new concept is typically introduced with a biological example; the concept is then developed without the biological context and then the concept is tied into additional biological examples. This allows students to first see why a certain concept is important, then lets them focus on how to use the concepts without getting distracted by applications, and then, once students feel more comfortable with the concepts, it revisits the biological applications to make sure that they can apply the concepts. The text features exceptionally detailed, step-by-step, worked-out examples and a variety of problems, including an unusually large number of word problems in a biological context.",N/A,N/A,en

"Opticks: Or, A Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light",['Sir Isaac Newton'],1704,['Calculus'],"Unlike most of Isaac Newton's works, Opticks was originally published in English in 1702 [1704?], with the Latin version following in 1706. The work summarized Newton's discoveries and theories concerning light and color: the spectrum of the sunlight, the degrees of refraction associated with different colors, the color circle (the first in the history of color theory), the invention of the reflecting telescope; the first workable theory of the rainbow, and experiments on what would later be called ""interference effects"" in conjunction with Newton's rings. His discovery of periodicity in Newton's rings, which would later prove to be so useful to Thomas Young, led Newton to postulate that periodicity was a fundamental property either of light waves or of waves associated with light. Nevertheless, Newton preferred the corpuscular theory of light, with which he is usually associated, because of its explanatory value for certain optical phenomena and because it allowed him to link the action of gross bodies with the action of light. The first edition of the Opticks ends with two mathematical treatises in Latin, written to establish his priority over Leibnitz in the invention of the calculus.--J. Norton, 2006.",N/A,N/A,en

The Calculus Gallery,['William Dunham'],2005,['Mathematics'],"More than three centuries after its creation, calculus remains a dazzling intellectual achievement and the gateway into higher mathematics. This book charts its growth and development by sampling from the work of some of its foremost practitioners, beginning with Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late seventeenth century and continuing to Henri Lebesgue at the dawn of the twentieth--mathematicians whose achievements are comparable to those of Bach in music or Shakespeare in literature. William Dunham lucidly presents the definitions, theorems, and proofs. ""Students of literature read Shakespeare; students of music listen to Bach,"" he writes. But this tradition of studying the major works of the ""masters"" is, if not wholly absent, certainly uncommon in mathematics. This book seeks to redress that situation. Like a great museum, The Calculus Gallery is filled with masterpieces, among which are Bernoulli's early attack upon the harmonic series (1689), Euler's brilliant approximation of pi (1779), Cauchy's classic proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus (1823), Weierstrass's mind-boggling counterexample (1872), and Baire's original ""category theorem"" (1899). Collectively, these selections document the evolution of calculus from a powerful but logically chaotic subject into one whose foundations are thorough, rigorous, and unflinching--a story of genius triumphing over some of the toughest, most subtle problems imaginable. Anyone who has studied and enjoyed calculus will discover in these pages the sheer excitement each mathematician must have felt when pushing into the unknown. In touring The Calculus Gallery, we can see how it all came to be.",N/A,N/A,en
