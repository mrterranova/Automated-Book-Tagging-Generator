The Major Works,['Alexander Pope'],2006-10-12,['Literary Collections'],"This authoritative edition was first published in the acclaimed Oxford Authors series under the general editorship of Frank Kermode. It brings together a unique combination of Pope's poetry and prose - the major poems in their entirety, together with translations, criticism, letters and other prose - to give the essence of his work and thinking. Pope has often been termed the first truly professional poet in English, whose dealings with the book trade helped to produce the literary market-place of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In this representative selection of Pope's most important work, the texts are presented in chronological sequence so that the Moral Essays and Imitations of Horace are restored to their original position in his career. The Dunciad, The Rape of the Lock, and Peri Bathous are presented in full, together with a characteristic sample of Pope's prose, including satires, pamphlets, and periodical writing. The influential preface to his edition of Shakespeare is here, as well as passages from his conversations with Joseph Spence and examples of his wide-ranging correspondence. This fine edition features a comprehensive biographical index, as well as an introduction and invaluable notes.",N/A,N/A,en

Eureka Street,['Robert McLiam Wilson'],1997,['Fiction'],"Romantic Ireland is definitely dead and gone. With the exhilarating Eureka Street, Robert McLiam Wilson cheerfully and obscenely sends it to its grave. Jake Jackson, his thoughtful anti-hero, finds Belfast's tragedies are built on comedy: Catholics and Protestants so intent on declaring their differences ""resembled no one now as much as they resembled each other…. That was what I liked about Belfast hatred. It was a lumbering hatred that could survive completely on the memories of things that never existed in the first place."" He spends a certain amount of time worrying about seeming too Catholic and an equal amount worrying about not seeming sufficiently Catholic. Sometimes, after several drinks, Jake forgets that he's not a Protestant. Each position is as dangerous, and absurd, as the other. His best friend is less torn up. Chuckie Lurgan is a chubby Methodist whose only accomplishments so far have been shaking Reagan's hand, appearing in the same photo as the Pope, and having ""an intense and troubling relationship with mail-order catalogues."" But Chuckie suddenly surprises Jake with his first entrepreneurial scheme. Though he's placed an ad for an enormous sex toy in Northern Ireland's ""only mucky paper,"" he hasn't any intention of ever fulfilling an order. Instead, he follows legal protocol and sends each disappointed customer a refund check, in the proper amount, stamped GIANT DILDO REFUND. The gamble is that most people will be too embarrassed to cash them. ""Chuckie smiled the smile of the just-published poet."" And soon he has more than 40,000 pounds in the bank and a lust for big money. He also has a rich, new girlfriend: ""He hoped his dreams wouldn't suffer from all this reality.""Jake is more preoccupied with the day-to-day. His construction site job gives him ample opportunity to consider his romantic failures and the ever-present symbols of war. There's also a new graffito that has sprouted among the various deadly acronyms. IRA, UVF, and UDA make no more sense than OTG, but at least everyone knows what they stand for. OTG becomes a puzzle to all of Belfast--is it, the authorities wonder, a new terrorist group? (Jake also notes several other phrases, FTP, FTQ, and FTNP--the ""T"" stands for the and ""P"" and ""Q"" for Pope and Queen. The ""N"" is for Next.) Despite his love for Belfast, Jake loses heart with its zealots and fanatics and, halfway through, Eureka Street threatens to slide into windy bathos. It's only a momentary lapse amid energetic, colloquial poetry and comic realism.",4.5,N/A,en

The Relic,['Jose Maria Eca de Queiros'],2023-04-21,['Fiction'],"The Relic tells the story of an orphaned young man, Teodorico Raposo, who is brought to Lisbon from a provincial town in Portugal to live with his aunt, a rigid, stern—and oftentimes—forbidding Catholic. Her devout circle of acquaintances is made up almost entirely of priests, many of whom are more concerned with appearances than spirituality, and seeking her and their approval, Teodorico is driven to attend Mass, say rosaries, and frequent churches, all the while awakening to sensuality, women, and the material life in conflict with “Auntie’s” devotions, which are—inwardly—devoid of the charity preached by Christ. When Teodorico obtains a degree from the University of Coimbra, Auntie sends him to the Holy Land to search for a relic to cure her ills. He meets up with a learned German author and, after a sojourn to Egypt, the two make their way to the land trod by Jesus. It is there that Teodorico has the dream that takes up nearly one third of the novel: he witnesses the travails that lead to the Passion and Crucifixion, as well as the aftermath of Christ’s death. Faced now with his mission, Teodorico embarks on a search. He soon comes upon an item, a “true” relic authenticated by his German friend, the sanctity of which will send Auntie to the heights of spiritual bliss, so much so that she will make him her heir. But when Teodorico returns to Lisbon with it, deception awaits her as the result of a simple mistake that had been made, and disinheritance awaits him as a result of Auntie’s anger and vindictiveness.",N/A,N/A,en

He had inherited the family taint of the Rougon-Macquarts, which in him took the same form as in the case of his mother-a morbid religious enthusiasm bordering on hysteria. Brain fever followed, and bodily recovery left the priest without a mental past. Dr. Pascal Rougon, his uncle, hoping to save his reason, removed him from his accustomed surroundings and left him at the Paradou, the neglected demesne of a ruined mansion-house near Les Artaud, where he was nursed by Albine, niece of the caretaker.

Raised Italian-American,['Joseph Bonocore'],2005,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Raised Italian-American remembers the history, stories, traditions, and values of growing up in an Italian neighborhood. One of my fondest memories as a child was to take a ride and view the beautiful nativity scenes that were erected throughout the neighborhood each Christmas. The popularity of these large statues, they are called presepi in Italy, started in Italy in the 17th century when it was fashionable to find them in palaces and homes of wealthy citizens. The newfound enthusiasm of erecting a presepi during Christmas may be contributed to Saint Gaetano who openly encouraged people to create the presepi as a sign of devotion. It wasn't until the later part of the 19th century that these presepi became a part of family traditions in nearly every home in Italy. This set is a beautiful piece of art and is a prized possession of the families that own them. I know that Phyllis' grandmother cherished her presepi until the day she died and the family still think fondly of their grandmother every time they see it at Christmas time.",N/A,N/A,en
American Catholicism,['John Tracy Ellis'],1969-06-15,['History'],"The Catholic Church remains one of the oldest institutions of Western civilization. It continues to withstand attack from without and defection from within. In his revision of American Catholicism, Monsignor Ellis has added a new chapter on the history of the Church since 1956. Here he deals with developments in Catholic education, with the changing relations of the Church to its own members and to society in general, and especially with arguments for and against the ecumenical movement brought about by Vatican Council II. The author gives an updated historical account of the part played by Catholics in both the American Revolution and the Civil War, and of the difficulties within the Church that came with the clash of national interests among Irish, French, and Germans in the nineteenth century. He regards immigration as the key to the increasingly important role of American Catholicism in the nation after 1820. For contemporary America, the author counts among the signs of the mature Church an increase in Church membership, the presence of nine Americans in the College of Cardinals in May, 1967, and the expansion of American effort in Catholic missions throughout the world.",N/A,N/A,en

The Opinions of Jérôme Coignard,['Anatole France'],1913,['Booksellers and bookselling'],"This is a lovely collection of short pieces of conversation with the “Abbe” having a mildly anarchistic but strong humanistic bent. Very odd, cultured and entertaining. The book centers around the character of M. l'abbé Jérôme Coignard, a professor, a librarian, and a philosopher known for his witty observations on politics, morality, and human nature. Through a series of dialogues and reflections, the narrative explores themes of skepticism, the folly of mankind, and the complexities of faith and knowledge, highlighting Coignard's unique blend of liberal ideas rooted in his Catholic faith. The opening of the work introduces M. Jérôme Coignard and establishes his background as a learned yet disillusioned man who has encountered tragic experiences, foreshadowing his philosophical musings. A disciple named Jacques Tournebroche admires Coignard and recounts his teachings, which reflect a deep skepticism about human nature and society. Coignard's views on various subjects, including politics and religion, are outlined through lively conversations, particularly one with a bookseller where he critiques the roles of politicians. This initial setting paints a vivid portrait of Coignard's character and sets the stage for deeper explorations of his philosophical insights as the story unfolds.",N/A,N/A,en

"Confederate Catholics at War, 1641-49",['Pádraig Lenihan'],2001,['History'],"This book evaluates the Confederate Catholic war effort from the preceeding phase of localized insurgency, through the formation of a national self-government in 1642, until the Confederate Catholic regime was finally subsumed in a broad pan-Royalist alliance in 1649. While this alliance held out the prospect of significant religious and constitutional concessons this achievement was nullified by the subsequent Cromwellian catastrophe: the Confederate regime failed. In attributing this failure to political factionalism, historians have neglected the potential and limitations of the Confederate war effort. This study does not substitute crude military determinism but acknowledges that political indecision and strategic incoherence inhibited the war effort at critical junctures. From the conflicting political priorities of Confederates two partially exclusive military strategies, insular, and expeditionary, can be identified. Both strategies were proactive and so demanded standing armies rather than local militia units. This book emphasizes the crucial importance of the tax gathering apparatus in fueling the incremental growth of standing armies. In the absence of large scale foreign patronage, exacting money from an agrarian economy, rather than the shortages of material, or still less, manpower representing the crucial extrinsic limit to Confederate military potential. Given these limits, it was a considerable achievement to contain two British interventions (in 1642 and 1646/7 respectively). The influence of the contemporaneous ""military revolution"" on the European mainland was mediated by the cadre of returned mercenary officers. Consequently, the Confederates developed a qualitative edge in fortification and siegecraft. The application of the continental model and the shift from putatively ""celtic"" or irregular tactics of raiding and running battles would be more problematic. This and other explanations for the poor battlefield performance of the Confederate armies are discussed.",5,N/A,en
Catholic Spirituality and Prayer in the Secular City,['Robert A. Burns'],2008,['Religion'],"""In the United States, against the background of secularization, the religious atmospheres have changed radically in the past forty years. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Immigration and Naturalization Act, which opened America's doors to immigrants from all over the world. As a result, approximately one million immigrants legally enter the United States each year and bring with them religious traditions such as Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Catholic Spirituality and Prayer in the Secular City presents the role of religion and spirituality in a rapidly changing religious scenario. Author Robert A. Burns explores ways Catholics have been called upon to develop their spiritual lives in the most religiously pluralistic society that has ever existed. Burns acknowledges the struggle that many people face when seeking a deeper spirituality and do not know where or how to begin, and seeks to guide readers through the confusion and back to the meaning of spirituality.""--BOOK JACKET.",N/A,N/A,en

Popular Catholicism in Nineteenth-Century Germany,['Jonathan Sperber'],2019-04-23,['History'],"Focusing on an area roughly equivalent to the contemporary state of North Rhine-Westphalia, this description of popular religious life between 1830 and 1880 revises established postitions of German historiography. It depicts thee increasing laicization of the first half of the nineteenth century, with its mediocre church attendance and secularized morality, and goes on to show how the two decdes after 1850 reversed the trend toward secularization. During the latter period, renewal of the people's loyalty to the church encouraged a developing political Catholicism. The author demonstrates that urbanization and industrialization may well have strengthened popular piety, rather than weakening it. He considers a variety of political implications of popular religious life, from the revolution of 1848/49 to the Kulturkampf of the 1870s, and see political Catholicism in Germany as asrising not exclusively from church-state confrontations but from the interaction of new religious practices with a changing socioeconomic environment and a counter-revolutionary ideology.

Known for his caustic wit and satirical outlook as much as he was for his formal expertise, Pope is arguably the most important English poet of the eighteenth century. His work influenced such figures as William Wordsworth, Samuel Johnson, and Jonathan Swift. Drawing on his immense knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin literature, Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock is a mock epic which captures the essence of classical divinity and poetry while illuminating the absurdity and stupidity of English aristocratic life. The poem centers on a Baron's obsession with the hair of the beautiful socialite Belinda. Although her hair is protected by divine Sylphs, the Baron eventually succeeds, using a pair of scissors to snip off a lock of Belinda's hair. This throws the world of the poem into chaos--Belinda is outraged, and the divine creatures which move invisibly between worlds try their best to restore order to the universe. The poem culminates with a battle between Belinda and the Baron, mimicking the heroism and warfare of the best of Homer while casting a critical eye on the values of England's elite. The Rape of the Lock and Other Poems contains seven of Pope's best works--with notes for each--including his highly influential An Essay on Criticism, a manifesto in poetic form on the art and history of poetry. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock and Other Poems is a classic of English literature reimagined for modern readers.",N/A,N/A,en

Occasions of Faith,['Lawrence J. Taylor'],1995-04,['Religion'],"Devotional ""occasions"", or experiences by Irish Catholics form the crux of this powerful, first book-length anthropological study of Irish Catholicism. Questions central to the study of religion inform Occasions of Faith: What is religion and how do ""official"" and ""popular"" religion differ? What is the relation between power and meaning? What are the roles of religious and political ""regimes"" in the social construction of religion? In exploring these questions, the book draws on two major theoretical traditions in the anthropological study of religion: the tradition of Geertz, Douglas, and Turner and that of Marx, Foucault, and Asad. Even the powerful religious regime Taylor finds in Irish Catholicism must leave ""creative space"" for what he calls a ""religious imagination."" Basic fears and needs propel the people of southwest Donegal - and all of us, Taylor argues - to respond creatively to strong personal religious experiences and to invent forms to express them.",N/A,N/A,en

Echoes,['Danielle Steel'],2004,['Fiction'],"Against a vivid backdrop of history, Danielle Steel tells a compelling story of love and war, acts of faith and acts of betrayal…and of three generations of women as they journey though years of loss and survival, linked by an indomitable devotion that echoes across time. For the Wittgenstein family, the summer of 1915 was a time of both prosperity and unease, as the guns of war sound in the distance. But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer of awakening. By the glimmering waters of Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. And as the two built a new life together, Beata’s past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler’s terror threatens her life and family—even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun. For Amadea, the convent is no refuge. As family and friends are swept away without a trace, Amadea is forced into hiding. Thus begins a harrowing journey of survival, as she escapes into the heart of the French Resistance. Here Amadea will find a renewed sense of purpose, taking on the most daring missions behind enemy lines. And it is here, in the darkest moments of fear, that Amadea will feel her mother’s loving strength—and that of her mother’s mother before her–as the voices of lost loved ones echo powerfully in her heart. And here, amid the fires of war, Amadea will meet an extraordinary man, British secret agent Rupert Montgomery. In Colonel Montgomery, Amadea finds a man who will help her discover her place in an unbreakable chain between generations…and between her lost family and her dreams for the future—a future she is only just beginning to imagine: a future of hope rooted in the rich soil of the past. With the grace of a master storyteller, Danielle Steel breathes life into history, creating a bold, sweeping tale filled with unforgettable characters and breathtaking images—from the elegant rituals of Europe’s prewar aristocracy to the brutal desperation of Germany’s death camps. Drawing us into a vanished world, Echoes weaves an intricate tapestry of a mother’s love, a daughter’s courage…and the unwavering faith that sustained them—even in history’s darkest hour.",N/A,N/A,en

The anti-Catholic prejudice that many blamed for presidential candidate Alfred E. Smith's crushing defeat in 1928 at last seemed to have been overcome. However, if the presidential election of 1960 was indeed a turning point for American Catholics, how do we explain the failure of any Catholic--in over forty years--to repeat Kennedy's accomplishment?

Dom Casmurro,['Machado de Assis'],1997,['Fiction'],"""A palm tree, seeing me troubled and divining the cause, murmured in its branches that there was nothing wrong with fifteen-year old boys getting into corners with girls of fourteen; quite the contrary, youths of that age have no other function, and corners were made for that very purpose. It was an old palm-tree, and I believed in old palm-trees even more than in old books. Birds, butterflies, a cricket trying out its summer song, all the living things of the air were of the same opinion."" So begins this extraordinary love story between Bento and Capitu, childhood sweethearts who grow up next door to each other in Rio de Janeiro in the 1850s. Like other great nineteenth century novels--The Scarlet Letter, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary--Machado de Assis's Dom Casmurro explores the themes of marriage and adultery. But what distinguishes Machado's novel from the realism of its contemporaries, and what makes it such a delightful discovery for English-speaking readers, is its eccentric and wildly unpredictable narrative style. Far from creating the illusion of an orderly fictional ""reality,"" Dom Casmurro is told by a narrator who is disruptively self-conscious, deeply subjective, and prone to all manner of marvelous digression. As he recounts the events of his life from the vantage of a lonely old age, Bento continually interrupts his story to reflect on the writing of it: he examines the aptness of an image or analogy, considers cutting out certain scenes before taking the manuscript to the printer, and engages in a running, and often hilarious, dialogue with the reader. ""If all this seems a little emphatic, irritating reader,"" he says, ""it's because you have never combed a girl's hair, you've never put your adolescent hands on the young head of a nymph..."" But the novel is more than a performance of stylistic acrobatics. It is an ironic critique of Catholicism, in which God appears as a kind of divine accountant whose ledgers may be balanced in devious as well as pious ways. It is also a story about love and its obstacles, about deception and self-deception, and about the failure of memory to make life's beginning fit neatly into its end. First published in 1900, Dom Casmurro is one of the great unrecognized classics of the turn of the century by one of Brazil's greatest writers. The popularity of Machado de Assis in Latin America has never been in doubt and now, with the acclaim of such critics and writers as Susan Sontag, John Barth, and Tony Tanner, his work is finally receiving the worldwide attention it deserves. Newly translated and edited by John Gledson, with an afterword by Joao Adolfo Hansen, this Library of Latin America edition is the only complete, unabridged, and annotated translation of the novel available. It offers English-speaking readers a literary genius of the rarest kind.",4,N/A,en
