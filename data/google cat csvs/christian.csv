Same-soul Desire in Late Medieval England,['B. Joy Ambler'],2017,['Electronic dissertations'],"In this study, I explore to what extent an erotic orientation toward others' spiritual characteristics, specifically with regard to ""clean"" souls, was strongly idealized in at least two medieval English locales, the central Midlands and the North Riding of Yorkshire. Where a hetero-genital orientation was pervasively considered proper with regard to erotic attraction then as today, I propose that, additionally, a desire to associate on a spiritual level with not only those of the same religion but also of like spiritual purity governed desire. As I will argue, this orientation to a spiritual sameness stemmed from a meme of preferred association in life with other Christians with clean souls. I refer to this desire for association with Christian sameness as a homo-spiritual orientation. As I will argue, this homospirituality was the primary basis of erotic desire portrayed and prescribed in the evidence considered in this study. In sum, I argue that fifteenth-century English ways of knowing and feeling desire, reflected in models of desire in romance poetry in these two locales, evidences an erotic orientation based on homospiritual lines of attraction. Moreover, in each area, the models of lay homospiritual erotics were preceded by and coincided with religious writings on the subject that contributed to an overall intellectual current.",N/A,N/A,en

A Legacy,"['Bob Payne', 'Rev. R. R. (Bob) Payne']",2018-05-04,[],"For over fifty years, Bob Payne has watched with dismay and alarm the continuing deterioration of standards and morals. A 'true-blue Aussie', he has identified with such morally renowned figures as the Reverend Fred Nile, Jim Wallace, Lyle Shelton and others, to speak against our continuing moral decay and encourage moral and spiritual renewal. He regards mooted Republicanism a treasonous and treacherous rejection of Australia's Judaeo Christian heritage. An ordained Baptist minister, he has struggled against continually mounting odds to create Australia's first resident-funded retirement village; to warn against the evils of alcohol and gambling; to decry the atrocity of abortion; to stem the further erosion of wholesome moral values and ethics; to warn against the infiltration and menace of Islam; and to encourage a fair Australian Cosmopolitanism instead of the present divisive, mischievous multiculturalism. Unafraid and unashamed to press for what he knows is right, he continues to speak against same-sex unions, homosexual abnormality and all vices, while promoting all that is of virtue and decency. He cites the Holy Bible and the preaching of Jesus Christ as his mandate and references for so doing. His Christian upbringing, his life of Gospel preaching, and his continual struggles to fight for what he knows is right and just, has led him to write this telling book. A clarion call to arms, his book was initially conceived as a legacy to his three sons John, Andrew and David. Now 84, Bob realises that his words need to go to a wider audience while there is still time, and before it is too late for spiritually lost people to find and experience salvation - from Australia's quagmire of immorality and benighted animistic, heathen and pagan religiosity. CAN YOU HANDLE SOME TRUTH? A Legacy clearly distinguishes between left and right; evil and good; vice and virtue; flesh and spirit; and the world and church, as Bob explains life's meaning.",N/A,N/A,en

When God Calls,['Edwin Troyer'],2019,['Christian'],"Sometimes God calls us to unexpected places. When Edwin and Edna Troyer were called to mission work in Northwestern Ontario, it was the first time they had ever set foot in the small, remote reserve of Slate Falls. A float plane delivered the couple and their three children to their new home--a rustic mission house with an old woodstove for heating and no indoor plumbing. Their only form of communication with the outside world was a community telephone in one of the neighbor's homes, and the only way out was by float plane, like the one that had left them there. As the Troyer family settled into Slate Falls and met their neighbors, they realized there was much work to do among the people. The winters were harsh and unforgiving, and sometimes the people were likewise. Many people didn't speak English, and those who did weren't incredibly fluent. Yet despite the many challenges they faced, the Troyers knew that God had sent them there for a reason: to share the Gospel. Their job was to plant seeds. They had to trust God to do the rest. And He did. One by one, people began accepting Jesus into their hearts. Because of the Troyer's obedience, God used them to change some of the hearts of His people--one life, one soul, at a time. Their faithfulness then, and still today, should inspire us all to be willing to answer God's call and follow wherever He leads. --From back cover.",N/A,N/A,en
