After outlining the quest for the historical church (parallel to the quest for the historical Jesus) and reviewing the sources, James Dunn follows the course of the movement stemming from Jesus beginning from Jerusalem. / He opens with a close analysis of what can be said of the earliest Jerusalem community, the Hellenists, the mission of Peter, and the emergence of Paul. Then Dunn focuses solely on Paul the chronology of his life and mission, his understanding of his call as apostle, and the character of the churches that he founded.

The Didache,['Aaron Milavec'],2003,['Religion'],"""In this study, Aaron Milavec comprehensively examines how the first-century pastoral manual known as the Didache enumerated the step-by-step training of converts for the full, active participation in the earliest Jewish-Christian communities. Milavec shows how the Didache can, in turn, illuminate our understanding of how these first Christian men and women organized their community life socially, religiously, and politically in order to safeguard its members from the challenges of the surrounding Roman, pagan society of the first-century Mediterranean basin. He argues not only that the Didache's textual and contextual clues demonstrate the document's organic unity from beginning to end, but also that it dates from a period before the gospels were written and had gained acceptance.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Ascension and Ecclesia,['Douglas Farrow'],1999-11,['Religion'],"Recent theology offers few attempts to come to grips with the meaning and implications of the ascension of Jesus. Ascension and Ecclesia promises to refocus attention on this crucial Christian doctrine. Farrow begins with a discussion of the biblical treatment of the ascension and eucharistic celebration, from which emerges a unique ecclesial worldview. Succeeding chapters explore the link between the ascension, cosmology, and ecclesiology and examine the difficulties faced by the doctrine of ascension in our modern scientific world.",N/A,N/A,en

The Community of the Beloved Disciple,['Raymond Edward Brown'],1979,['Religion'],"""This study in Johannine ecclesiology reconstructs the history of one Christian community in the first century -- a community whose life from its inception to its last hour is reflected in the Gospel and Epistles of John. It was a community that struggled with the world, with the Jews, and with other Christians. Eventually the struggle spread even to its own ranks. It was, in short, a community not unlike the Church of today. This book offers a different view of the traditional Johannine eagle. In the Gospel the eagle soars above the earth, but with talons bared for the fray. In the Epistles we discover the eaglets tearing at each other for possession of the nest"" -- Back cover.",5,N/A,en

The Voice of Conscience,['Lewis V. Baldwin'],2010,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Before he was a civil rights leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., was a man of the church. His father was a pastor, and much of young Martin's time was spent in Baptist churches. He went on to seminary and received a Ph.D. in theology. In 1953, he took over leadership of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Atlanta. The church was his home. But, as he began working for civil rights, King became a fierce critic of the churches, both black and white. He railed against white Christian leaders who urged him to be patient in the struggle - or even opposed civil rights altogether. And, while the black church was the platform from which King launched the struggle for civil rights, he was deeply ambivalent toward the church as an institution, and saw it as in constant need of reform. In this book, Lewis Baldwin explores King's complex relationship with the Christian church, from his days growing up at Ebenezer Baptist, to his work as a pastor, to his battles with American churches over civil rights, to his vision for the global church. King, Baldwin argues, had a robust and multifaceted view of the nature and purpose of the church that serves as a model for the church in the 21st century.",5,N/A,en
Life and Practice in the Early Church,['Steve McKinion'],2001-08,['Religion'],"A collection of primary texts revealing how early Christians practiced their faith Life and Practice in the Early Church brings together a range of primary texts from the church's first five centuries to demonstrate how early Christians practiced their faith. Rather than focusing on theology, these original documents shed light on how early believers ""did church,"" addressing such practical questions as, how did the church administer baptism? How were sermons delivered? How did the early church carry out its missions endeavors? Early Christian writings reveal a great deal about the tradition, as well as the wider culture in which it developed. Far from being monolithic, the documents which present the voices of the early church fathers in their own words demonstrate variation and diversity regarding how faith was worked out during the patristic period. The texts illuminate who was eligible for baptism, what was expected of worshippers, how the Eucharist was celebrated, and how church offices and their functions were organized. Contextual introductions explain practices and their development for those with little prior knowledge of Christian history or tradition. The pieces included here, all in accessible English translation, represent such sources as Justin Martyr, Tertullian, the Cappadocians, Cyril of Jerusalem, John Chrysostom, and Augustine.",N/A,N/A,en

Pastor Jim Cymbala believes that Jesus wants to renew his people-to call us back from spiritual dead ends, apathy, and lukewarm religion. Cymbala knows the difference firsthand. Thirty-five years ago his own church, the Brooklyn Tabernacle, was a struggling congregation of twenty. Then they began to pray ... God began to move ... street-hardened lives by the hundreds were changed by the love of Christ ... and today they are more than ten thousand strong.

A number of existing articles have been rewritten to reflect new evidence or understanding, for example the Holy Sepulchre entry, and there are a few new articles.

Nine Marks of a Healthy Church,['Mark Dever'],2004,['Religion'],"Did you know that . . .FROGS drink through their skin? Instead of swallowing water with their mouths, frogs absorb moisture through their skin. Frogs can also take in oxygen through their skin, which helps them breathe better in the water.FROGS eat with their eyes closed? The eyes help the frog swallow by lowering into its head and pushing the food down its throat.FROGS can jump 20 times their own length? That’s like a human jumping past four school buses in one leap!FROGS have sticky tongues? Frogs don’t use their hands to catch food . . . they just stick out their tongues! Flies, mosquitoes, and other yummy bugs stick to the tip and get pulled into the frog’s mouth for dinner.SOME FROGS wear camouflage? Stripes and spots help frogs blend into their natural surroundings. Some frogs can even change color depending on their location or the weather.FROGS recycle? Frogs shed their skin about once a week. Then they eat the old skin to reuse the nutrients stored inside.FROGS can live to be 40 years old? Most frogs live from 4 to 15 years.A FROG wasn’t always a frog? Every frog starts as a tiny egg that hatches into a tadpole. A tadpole has a round head and a tail and lives in the water like a fish. The tadpole eats a lot as its body changes and grows new parts. After three to four months, the tadpole has four legs and no tail and can live on land—it has become a frog!AWESOME!Did you know that you can become a new creature, too? You may not have a tail and live in the water, but God can give you a new life. Do you sometimes do things that make you feel bad inside? Maybe you were mean to someone at school or told a lie to your parents. God calls those bad things sin. Everyone is born knowing how to sin, and everyone who sins must be punished. But God, who loves us, doesn’t want us to sin. He wants us to be like Him—loving, kind, and good. Just as a tadpole changes into a frog, God can help you become more like Him. God sent His only Son, Jesus, to earth to be a human, just like us, except Jesus never sinned. Even so, He chose to die so that He could pay the death penalty for our sins. Three days after He died, God raised Him back to life again!Do you want to have a clean, new life? Then just believe in what Jesus did for you. Tell God that you are sorry for your sins and thank Him for sending Jesus to save you. The Bible says, “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!” (2 Corinthians 5:17). God will change you on the inside to make you a totally new creature—just like a tadpole changes into a frog. To do this, you can pray something like this:Dear God, I am sorry for the bad things I do. Thank You for sending Jesus to pay the penalty for my sins. Please change me on the inside and help keep me from sin so I can live a clean, new life for You. Amen.If you have just prayed to ask God to change you, write your name and address on the lines below and send it to us.

Vitoria: Political Writings,['Francisco de Vitoria'],1991-10-31,['History'],"Francisco Vitoria was the earliest and arguably the most important of the Thomist political philosophers of the Counter-Reformation. Not only did he write important essays on civil and ecclesiastical power, but he became celebrated for his defence of the new world Indians against the imperialism of his own master, the King of Spain. Vitoria's political works are thus of great importance for an understanding both of the rise of modern absolutism, and the debate about the emergent imperialism of the European powers. His works are also unusually accessible, since they survive mainly in the form of 'relectiones', or summaries delivered at the end of his lecture courses on law and theology at the University of Salamanca. Translated here into English for the first time, these texts comprise the core of Vitoria's thought, and will be of interest to specialists in political theory and the history of ideas, ecclesiastical history, and the history of early modern Spain.

Ranging from the thought of the first generation of Russian ZmigrZs to contemporary Eastern Orthodox theologians, the essays in Tradition Alive point toward a positive theology that is convinced of the immanence of the holy spirit despite a world torn apart by revolution, violence, and despair. The contributors profess their faith in the transforming presence of Christ and the divine dimensions of the church by looking to the meaning and power of tradition in the practices of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. By focusing on the Orthodox Church's ecclesial and liturgical character, the authors emphasize the living character of the Christian tradition.

When Pentecostals in the USA ventured into politics, they became allied with the Republican party, and later Donald Trump. The Swedish Pentecostals took another route: while culturally conservative, they embraced the progressive economic politics of the Social Democratic party. During the 2010s, they have also rejected the nationalism of the growing populist movement.

In this short and penetrating study, Paul McPartlan, a member of the international Roman Catholic-Orthodox theological dialogue, presents a proposal, carefully argued both historically and theologically, for a primacy exercising a service of love in a reconciled church, West and East. McPartlan builds on the substantial foundation already laid in the dialogue for an understanding of the church in terms of the Eucharist. Eucharistic ecclesiology has been one of the most remarkable developments in the theological renewal of recent decades. Drawing particularly on scriptural and patristic teaching, it offers a highly promising framework for resolving this most sensitive and difficult of issues -- recognising the bishop of Rome as the focal point and servant of the Eucharistic communion among bishops. Vatican II directed that those working for reconciliation between Catholics and Orthodox pay close attention to the relationships that pertained between the Eastern churches and the see of Rome before the split of 1054. McPartlan seeks to do just that, notably incorporating the teaching of the council on the role of the papacy to craft a proposal that may commend itself to Catholics and to Orthodox.",N/A,N/A,en
"Dispensationalism, Israel and the Church",['Craig A. Blaising'],1992,['Medical'],"The relationship between Israel and the church is a crucial reference point in theology, especially in distinguishing between dispensational and nondispensational schools of thought. The writers of this book view Israel and the church as distinct theological institutions within the historical progress of divine revelation. But they are also related as successive phases of a redemptive program that is historically progressive and eschatologically converging. The goal of the book is a convergence of ideas among evangelical scholars in recognizing both continuity and discontinuity in the Israel-church relationship. - Back cover.",N/A,N/A,en

Cyprian the Bishop,['J. Patout Burns'],2002,['Biography & Autobiography'],"This is the first up-to-date, accessible study on the rule of Cyprian as the Bishop of Carthage in the 250s AD. It controversially shows that Cyprian radically enforced the primary emphasis on the unity of the church, interpreting loyalty in the community as fidelity to Christ. It uses cultural anthropology to examine the impact of Cyprian's policy during the Decian persecution. Cyprian attempted to steer the middle ground between compromise and traditionalism and succeeded by defining the boundary between the empire and the church. J. Patout Burns Jr. concentrates on social structures to reveal the logic of Cyprian's plan, the basis for its success in his time, and why it later failed.

Its influence was felt immediately throughout all of China and much of the rest of Asia. There was a great demand for an edition in English, so the author made the translation himself and it was published under the title, Concerning Our Missions. But at that time its message made no extensive penetration into North America. Today, however, there is an increasing hunger for reality in Christian experience, and for renewed power and life among groups of believers who long to be a local expression of the Body of Christ.

The author, one of the greatest theologians of the 20th century and a convert from Protestantism, contributed significantly to the movement out of which came the Second Vatican Council's efforts to promote Christian unity. He shows how Catholic teaching is often misunderstood by Catholics and Protestants alike, and how this teaching is fundamentally compatible with key positive elements of Reformation thought. He also examines the main points of disagreement between Catholicism and Protestantism, and demonstrates how Catholicism, properly understood, maintains the theological balance necessary to uphold some of the main truths on which Catholics and Protestants agree.",N/A,N/A,en

On the Church Militant,"['Robert Bellarmine', 'St Robert Bellarmine S J']",2016-06-10,[],"St. Robert Bellarmine's theological writings on the Church of Christ constitute an invaluable treasure not only for Catholics, but for the commonweal and eternal salvation of humanity itself. This is no slight exaggeration. His is the very first independent theological and dogmatic treatise on the Church. Patristic and medieval Catholic authors treated on the mystery of the Church, to be sure; but they provided no free-standing treatment de ecclesia.Bellarmine's is the first and the best of its kind. From the Foreword St. Robert Bellarmine's On the Church Militant is the first ever English language translation of his treatise De Ecclesia Militante, dealing with questions such as, what is the Church? Who is in the Church? How do we define it? Not only does Bellarmine define it, he refutes false notions of the Church, such as the Protestant contention that the Church is invisible, as well as ancient heresies that bear upon the modern debate such as, are only the good in the Church? Are sinners also in the Church? As always, Bellarmine answers the question directly from Scripture, the Fathers and right reason to show us clearly that there is a visible Church composed of those united in the same profession of faith and unity of the Sacraments, irrespective of their interior disposition. This is the latest from the Bellarmine translation project, which aims to translate the whole of Bellarmine's De Controversiis into English.

This very readable and informative treatment of such a vital topic fills an important gap in Adventist literature. Reinder Bruinsma's far-ranging look at the doctrine of the church moves from Old and New Testament foundations for this doctrine up through church government and on to controversial issues such as ordination and church discipline. Fittingly, he concludes with the mission and future of the church. His fourfold approach-biblical and theological, historical, practical, and with an Adventist perspective-ensures that every facet of the doctrine is explored in detail. This thought-provoking discussion challenges those who call themselves ""God's people"" to examine their current understanding of the church and to prayerfully consider their roles as part of the body of Christ.

Introduction to the Mystery of the Church,"['Benoit-Dominique de La Soujeole, OP']",2014,['Religion'],"Introduction to the Mystery of the Church is an ecclesiological survey presenting a doctrinal synthesis of the Church.

The book is divided into two major parts, the first presenting the foundations in the Bible and the tradition up to our day, and the second being an explanatory proposal introducing the reader to the Church's definition and personality and concluding with an exposition of the four properties enunciated in the Creed (one, holy, catholic, and apostolic). The value of this way of proceeding is first and foremost in the proposal of a synthesis that allows one to situate each question in its rightful place, such study being oriented toward a better overall grasp of the subject. As the title suggests, the book is an introduction that should allow the reader to apprehend the mystery in its internal coherence in order subsequently, with the aid of other texts, to be able to enter more deeply into the study of one or other specific point.

Theology in the Russian Diaspora,['Aidan Nichols'],1989,['Religion'],"The author at the centre of this study, Russian priest-theologian Nikolai Nikolaevich Afanas'ev, was perhaps the most influential thinker about the Church Russia has produced. In Aidan Nichols's careful evaluation, he emerges as a key figure in the rapprochement of Christian East and West, and most notably of the Orthodox and Catholic churches. Nichols illustrates how Afanas'ev has been influential in two key respects: first of all in his conviction that the Eucharist constitutes the foundation of the whole Church; and secondly in his contribution to an Orthodox understanding of the role of the Roman Church and bishop in the context of a united Church. Afanas'ev's achievements are seen to have continuing relevance in view of the inauguration of the Orthodox-Catholic dialogue at the monastery of St John on Patmos in 1980, and the importance of his thinking in terms of contemporary ecumenism becomes clear. It is to such a reappraisal that this book - concerned as it is with how Russian orthodoxy understands the Church - is devoted, in the hope of an eventual restoration of unity between the Orthodox of all the Russias and the see of Rome.",N/A,N/A,en

Such ""category 5"" realities as postmodernism, postChristendom attacks on belief in God, and the threat of global warming have coalesced to make a ""perfect storm"" that will leave people uncertain of their place in the world, and all they have previously believed in.

The Didache,['Aaron Milavec'],2003,['Religion'],"Most Christians believe that everything about Jesus and the early church can be found in their New Testament. In recent years, however, the discovery of the Gospel of Thomas and the reconstruction of the Q-Gospel have led scholars to recognize that some very early materials were left out. Now, due to the pioneering efforts of Dr. Aaron Milavec, the most decisive document of them all, namely, the Didache (""Did-ah-Kay""), has come to light. Milavec has decoded the Didache and enabled it to reveal its hidden secrets regarding those years when Christianity was little more than a faction within the restless Judaisms of the mid-first-century. The Didache reveals a tantalizingly detailed description of the prophetic faith and day-to-day routines that shaped the Jesus movement some twenty years after the death of Jesus. The focus of the movement then was not upon proclaiming the exalted titles and deeds of Jesus - aspects that come to the fore in the letters of Paul and in the Gospel narratives. In contrast to these familiar forms of Christianity, the focus of the Didache was upon ""the life and the knowledge"" of Jesus himself. Thus, the Didache details the step-by-step process whereby non-Jews were empowered by assimilating the prophetic faith and the way of life associated with Jesus of Nazareth. Milavec's clear, concise, and inspiring commentaries are not only of essential importance to scholars, pastors, and students but also very useful for ordinary people who wish to unlock the secrets of the Didache. Milavec's analytic, Greek-English side-by-side, gender-inclusive translation is included as well as a description of how this document, after being fashioned and used 50-70 C.E., was mysteriously lost for over eighteen hundred years before being found in an obscure library in Istanbul. The study questions, bibliography, and flowcharts enable even first-time users to grasp the functional and pastoral genius that characterized the earliest Christian communities.",N/A,N/A,en

Perspectives on Ecclesiology and Ethnography,['Pete Ward'],2012-03-15,['Religion'],"Within the disciplines of religious studies, systematic theology, and practical theology there exists a divide between empirical and theological analyses of the church. Each volume in the cross-disciplinary series Studies in Ecclesiology and Ethnography attempts to address this gap by exploring the methodological and substantive issues that arise from both theological and empirical studies of the church's practices and social reality. Perspectives on Ecclesiology and Ethnography, the inaugural volume in the series, proposes that if theology is to regain its relevance to the church today, theologians must utilize ethnographical tools in order to provide more accurate, disciplined research that is situated in real contexts. Using ""ethnography"" in its broadest sense -- encompassing any form of qualitative research -- this volume proposes that the church is both theological and social/cultural, which implies the need for a methodological shift for researchers in theology. Contributions from twelve scholar-practitioners lead the way forward. Contributors Luke Bretherton Paul S. Fiddes Nicholas M. Healy Mary McClintock Fulkerson Alister E. McGrath Richard R.

The Continuing Conversion of the Church,['Darrell L. Guder'],2000-03-20,['Religion'],"Western society is now a very different, very difficult mission field. In such a situation, the mission of evangelism cannot succeed with an attitude of ""business as usual."" This volume builds a theology of evangelism that has its focus on the church itself. Darrell Guder shows that the church's missionary calling requires that the theology and practice of evangelism be fundamentally rethought and redirected, focused on the continuing evangelization of the church so that it can carry out its witness faithfully in today's world. In Part 1 Guder explores how, under the influence of reductionism and individualism, the church has historically moved away from a biblical theology of evangelism. Part 2 presents contemporary challenges to the church's evangelical ministry, especially those challenges that illustrate the church's need for continuing conversion. Part 3 discusses what a truly missional theology would mean for the church, including sweeping changes in its institutional structures and practices. Written for teachers, church leaders, and students of evangelism, this volume is vital reading for everyone engaged in mission work.",4.5,N/A,en
The Splendor of the Church,['Henri de Lubac'],1999-01-01,['Religion'],"Considered by many the bright jewel among the many enriching books of Cardinal Henri de Lubac, this work is a hymn to the beauty of the Church, under some of whose leaders for a time he unjustly suffered. The Splendor of the Church is, in a sense, a personal testimony of the great theologian's humility and love of the Church of Christ. It is also a classic work in the theology of the Church. Indeed, de Lubac's profound insights significantly contributed to Vatican II's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen Gentium, especially in its treatment on the Church as mystery and as the Sacrament of Christ. Chapters: I. The Church as Mystery II. The Dimensions of the Mystery III. The Two Aspects of the Church IV. The Heart of the Church V. The Church in the World VI. The Sacrament of Christ VII. Ecclesia Mater VIII. Our Temptations concerning the Church IX. The Church and Our Lady",3,N/A,en

The Critical Meaning of the Bible,['Raymond Edward Brown'],1981,['Religion'],"The Word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul, discerning the thoughts of the heart. So proclaims te Epistle to the Hebrews. Yet for many persons the biblical Word of God is less a sharp sword than a crutch, supporting rather than piercing them. Interpreted as they have ""always"" heard it, scripture tells them exactly what they want to hear. Modern critical investigation of the Bible can change that radically, for now Christians and the churches are being told that the biblical authors did not always mean what they were thought to have meant when read through the spectacles of later interests. Because of its approach, some Protestants and Catholics believe the new biblical criticism is impious. Raymond Brown, a Catholic priest who is Auburn Professor of Biblical Studies at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, argues strongly to the contrary. Critically interpreted, the Bible is all the more critical to Christians and the Church. The challenge of the scriptures is unleashed, ""piercing to the division of soul, discerning the thoughts of the heart."" - Back cover.",N/A,N/A,en
