Sketches of Thought,['Vinod Goel'],1995,['Psychology'],"Much of the cognitive lies beyond articulate, discursive thought, beyond the reach of current computational notions. In Sketches of Thought, Vinod Goel argues that the cognitive computational conception of the world requires our thought processes to be precise, rigid, discrete, and unambiguous; yet there are dense, ambiguous, and amorphous symbol systems, like sketching, painting, and poetry, found in the arts and much of everyday discourse that have an important, non-trivial place in cognition. Goel maintains that while on occasion our thoughts do conform to the current computational theory of mind, they often are - indeed must be - vague, fluid, ambiguous, and amorphous. He argues that if cognitive science takes the classical computational story seriously, it must deny or ignore these processes, or at least relegate them to the realm of the nonmental. Along the way, Goel makes a number of significant and controversial interim points. He shows that there is a principled distinction between design and nondesign problems, that there are standard stages in the solution of design problems, that these stages correlate with the use of different types of external symbol systems, that these symbol systems are usefully individuated in Nelson Goodman's syntactic and semantic terms, and that different cognitive processes are facilitated by different types of symbol systems.",N/A,N/A

The Playful World,['Mark Pesce'],2000,['Computers'],"As you read these words, the architects of the new virtual reality are inventing a world you never imagined: call it the playful world. It's a world of interactive Web-based toys that instantly collapse the gulf between wish and existence, space and time, animate and inanimate. It's a world where the entire fabric of the material world becomes manipulable, programmable, mutable. Situated at the crossroads of high technology and popular culture, the playful world is taking shape at the speed of electronic creativity. Are you ready for it? Your kids are. In this spellbinding new book, Mark Pesce, one of the pioneers in the ongoing technological revolution, explores how a new kind of knowing and a new way of creating are transforming the culture of our time. It started, bizarrely enough, with Furbys, the first toys that had the ""will"" to grow and interact intelligently with their environment. As Pesce argues, Furbys, for all their cloying cuteness, were a vital sign of a new human endeavor--the ability to copy part of our own intelligence into the physical world. But engineers of the playful world have already gone much further into considerably stranger virtual realms. Pesce takes us inside the world's cutting-edge research facilities where the distinction between bits and atoms is rapidly dissolving. We meet the creators of LEGO Mindstorms, a snap-together plastic device that intelligently controls motors and processes data from sensors. We watch technological geniuses like Marvin Minsky and Eric Drexler turn the theoretical breakthroughs of Nobel laureate Richard Feynman into ""nanites""-- tiny ultra-high-speed computers that replicate intelligent life. We observe the launch of the amazing and much-anticipated Sony Playstation 2, a platform that will allow us to bring synthetic worlds into the home and create a gateway to the living planet. Web-based toys are only the beginning--the first glimmer of a new reality that is transforming our entire culture with incredible speed and power. After all, thanks to the computer revolution and the Internet, all of us already command powers that just a generation ago would have been described as magical. Magic is about to take on a whole new dimension. In this dazzling book, Mark Pesce offers a mind-bending preview of the incredible future that awaits us all in The Playful World.",N/A,N/A

Thus, National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) has suggested different principles to avoid the blunders, and to choice the ideal quality of hash function, that to be a measurement in future of hash function generations. Therefore, the goal of the NIST contenders in SHA-3 between the hash functions is to be chosen as the winner in the end of 2012, or the beginning of 2013. Therefore, for this reason the research addresses the comparative study of the finalist SHA-3 candidates in: design and structure, complexity, with performance and cost, to measure the robustness of the algorithms through the Fundamentals Security Measurement Factors of Hash Function (FSMFHF) of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). As a result, from this comprehensive comparison study between the finalist SHA-3 candidates such as; BLAKE, Grostl, JH, Keccak, and Skein, a choice can be made as to the ideal security algorithm against different attacks in suitable structure design of high utilizing of message distribution with high trade-off of speed/ area performance in low cost. Therefore main idea in this research is classify, comparison, and analysis for all five SHA-3 candidates of finalist, and studying the details of these five candidates that in Round 3 by using different structures and different design approaches, and identifying whether the complexity for each design.

Image analysis system for rapid data processing in Tradescantia-micronucleus bioassay,"['Xudong Jong', 'Guangheng Lin', 'Jianhua Xu', 'Wenjie Xia', 'Weichi Sun', 'Te-Hsiu Ma']",1990,['Biological monitoring'],"Tradescantia-micronucleus (Trad-MCN) bioassay is a well established short-term test for environmental mutagens in liquid or gaseous forms. For large-scale experiments that involve hundreds of slides, the micronuclei scoring process, data collection, and analysis are labor intensive and time consuming. Using computer image analysis process, a rapid data processing system was developed. This new facility is called the Trad-MCN Image Analysis System (Trad-MCN-IAS). The hardware of this system is composed of a photomicroscope attached to a video camera and a US-386 computer. The software for this system was written in FORTRAN language and run under an FG-105 real-time image processor. The operation begins with multi-threshold image segmentation, followed by mathematical morphology-based micronucleus extraction, and judging of normal tetrads with pseudo-color display. Using this system, a large number of tetrads (the four-cell stage of the meiotic pollen mother cells) image on the screen can be scored simultaneously for normal and micronucleus-bearing tetrads. The number of micronuclei in a large population of tetrads can be recorded and put in memory for data analysis. For high efficiency, four microscopes may be installed on a single Trad-MCN-IAS to gather tetrad images and count micronuclei; therefore a large number of samples can be scored and the experimental data processed in a short time. This system has several advantages: non-bias in the scoring process, automation, and minimizing the variance of scores introduced by different human observers.",N/A,N/A
