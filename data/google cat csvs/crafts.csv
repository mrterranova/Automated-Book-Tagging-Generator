The Summer That Shaped Us,['Lori Wilde'],2025-04-22,['Fiction'],"From New York Times bestselling author Lori Wilde comes her newest story about three generations of women, an island with an air of mystery and magic, and one summer that changes everything--perfect for fans of Jill Shalvis and Susan Mallery. In the Gulf of Mexico, near South Padre, sits a private island with a bit of a magic about it: the colors are brighter, the food tastes better, and turtles and cranes find sanctuary there. The billionaire heiress who built the thriving resort on Hobby Island exclusively for crafters, Eloisa Hobby, is as much a mystery as she is a mentor. Those with troubles are invited in the aftermath of an emotional turmoil, and with help from the other crafters on the island Eloisa acts as a sounding board while she gently and unobtrusively guides the visitors toward healthy resolutions in their lives. Only a few receive the honor of a golden ticket. Luna, ever the pragmatist, is reeling in the wake of tragedy: she's just moved with her fierce, opinionated teenage daughter Artemis to her mother's house, after they lost their husband and father. But her mother, Jeanie, artistic and sensitive, has faced her own troubles recently, and her home may not be the stable sanctuary the three women so desperately need. When Jeanie receives one of the coveted tickets, inviting her and her family to Hobby Island, the blessing is one they can't turn down, though both Luna and Artie remain skeptical of their eccentric host and benefactor. Together, the three of them will have to learn to trust one another again, accept help from those who love them, and embrace life--during a summer they'll never forget.",N/A,N/A,en

71 Arts & Crafts for School Children,['Editorial Board'],2013-09-16,[],"Art and Craft is a diverse and creative subject that allows kids to explore ideas or concepts and then express it by making something. Today arts and crafts are a great pastime and educational tool for kids. It can not only keep the tiny tots busy and entertained on a rainy day, but also extend a child's fine motor skills, develop concepts like colour or numbers and see scientific processes like gluing and paint drying in action. It also helps to develop the creative instincts of a child, who is ever so enthusiastic to learn and create something new. However, children always need their parents' or teachers' guidance, attention along with love and affection in their lives. Hence, drawing, painting or making simple, yet attractive craft items with them could be real fun and a great way to create a lifetime of memories for you and your children/students, as the case may be. The book is a treasure trove of novel ideas and beautiful creations of Arts and Crafts with easily available objects, such as: crayons, water and oil colours of different shades, glue, scissors, paper, wax, clay, stones, metal pieces, magnets, leaves, flowers, etc. There are collage items, various coloured paper craft items, marble painting, sculpting, greeting cards, paper lanterns, bookmarks, balloon mask, etc. that have been explained in the book in detail, exclusively for school children in the age group of 5 to 12 years. Thus, the book will serve as a useful guide for art and craft teachers as well as parents, who are always keen to decipher and carve out the best for the young ones.",N/A,N/A,en

How Crafts Matter,['Wendy Susan Landry'],2010,[],"Crafts in Canada have persisted and grown over the past century, despite being marginalised by industrialism and globalism. Crafts practice and the education of craftspeople has matured into a broad, expressive, cultural phenomenon. This has been accompanied by the blossoming of scholarship directed at illuminating the essential and distinctive character of crafts practices and objects. This growth has been supported in part by the relationship of crafts to creative visual arts production in the realms of fine arts and design. However, assimilation into the category of visual arts has distorted how crafts activity is understood, valued, and taught. In crafts degree programmes in Canada's four independent visual arts schools, the legitimate interests of craftspeople in the particular character, challenges, and import of their practices has been undermined by a dominant visual arts paradigm that has imposed ill-fitting curricula structures based on flawed underlying assumptions about crafts as a contemporary art form. This thesis examines the literature pertaining to crafts and its scholarship. It also provides a valuable portrayal of the historical and current situation of post-secondary professional crafts education at the degree level in the four Canadian art schools offering Bachelor degree in crafts education--Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Alberta College of Art and Design, Ontario College of Art and Design University, and Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University. It then offers a practitioner's perspective of the crafts world and the nature of crafting activity and creation. Finally it makes an impassioned plea for more concerted efforts to develop crafts scholars and scholarship, and for a well-grounded theoretical basis on which to base an appropriate craft education system tailored to the concerns of the contemporary crafts world. To further this goal, it proposes a framework based on material culture approaches to foster discussion and guide future developments and improvements in crafts education.",N/A,N/A,en
