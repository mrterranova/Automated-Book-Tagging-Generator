On Crimes and Punishments and Other Writings,['Cesare marchese di Beccaria'],2008,['Biography & Autobiography'],"This volume offers a new English translation of On Crimes and Punishments alongside writings by a number of Beccaria's contemporaries. Enlightened luminaries and monarchs alike looked to this text for ideas that might help guide the various reform projects of the day. Of particular interest is Voltaire's commentary on the text, which is included in its entirety. The supplementary materials testify not only to the power and significance of Beccaria's ideas, but to the controversial reception of his book. At the same that philosophes proclaimed that it contained principles of enduring importance to any society grappling with matters of political and criminal justice, allies of the ancien régime roundly denounced it, fearing that the book's attack on feudal privileges and its call to separate law from religion (and thus crime from sin) would undermine their longstanding privileges and powers.",N/A,N/A,en

Crime and Punishment,['Fyodor Dostoevsky'],2022-10-25,['Fiction'],"Poverty-stricken and cut off from society, former law student Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov leads a desolate life in a dreary little room in St Petersburg. Having abandoned all hopes of sustaining himself through work, he now obsesses over the idea of changing his fortunes through an act of extreme violence: the killing of an elderly pawnbroker. His mind baulks at the horror of his plan, but when he hears that his sister Dunya is about to agree to a loveless marriage in order to escape the advances of her employer, his disgust for the world becomes unbounded, and his feelings of rebellion and revenge push him closer and closer to the edge of the precipice. A masterpiece of psychological insight, Dostoevsky's 1866 novel features some of its author's most memorable characters – from the temperamental protagonist Raskolnikov to the amoral sensualist Svidrigailov and the immoral lawyer Luzhin.

Crime and Punishment,"['Fyodor Dostoyevsky', 'Constance Garnett Garnett']",2014-08-07,[],"Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (Dostoevsky), born on 11 November [O.S. 30 October] 1821, was the second child of Dr. Mikhail Dostoyevsky and Maria Dostoyevskaya (née Nechayeva). He was raised in the family home in the grounds of the Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor, which was in Moscow. Dostoyevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy tales and legends, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837, when he was 15, and around the same time he left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute. After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, Poor Folk, which gained him entry into St. Petersburg's literary circles.In 1849 he was arrested for his involvement in the Petrashevsky Circle, a secret society of liberal utopians that also functioned as a literary discussion group. He and other members were condemned to death, but at the last moment, a note from Tsar Nicholas I was delivered to the scene of the firing squad, commuting the sentence to four years' hard labour in Siberia. His seizures, which may have started in 1839, increased in frequency there, and he was diagnosed with epilepsy. On his release, he was forced to serve as a soldier, before being discharged on grounds of ill health.In the following years, Dostoyevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later A Writer's Diary, a collection of his writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a gambling addiction, which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded Russian writers. His books have been translated into more than 170 languages. Dostoyevsky influenced a multitude of writers and philosophers, from Anton Chekhov and Ernest Hemingway to Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre.On 25 January 1881, while searching for members of the terrorist organisation Narodnaya Volya (""The People's Will"") who would soon assassinate Tsar Alexander II, the Tsar's secret police executed a search warrant in the apartment of one of Dostoyevsky's neighbour. On the following day, Dostoyevsky suffered a pulmonary haemorrhage. Anna denied that the search had caused it, saying that the haemorrhage had occurred after her husband had been looking for a dropped pen holder. After another haemorrhage, Anna called the doctors, who gave a poor prognosis. A third haemorrhage followed shortly afterwards.Among Dostoyevsky's last words was his quotation of Matthew 3:14-15: ""But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptised of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness"", and he finished with ""Hear now-permit it. Do not restrain me!"" When he died, his body was placed on a table, following Russian custom. He was interred in the Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Convent, near his favourite poets, Karamsin and Zhukovsky. It is unclear how many attended his funeral. According to one reporter, more than 100,000 mourners were present, while others describe attendance between 40,000 and 50,000. His tombstone is inscribed with lines from the New Testamen.",N/A,N/A,en

Major Barbara,['Bernard Shaw'],2022-04-03,[],"Major Barbara is a three-act English play by George Bernard Shaw, written and premiered in 1905 and first published in 1907. The story concerns an idealistic young woman, Barbara Undershaft, who is engaged in helping the poor as a Major in the Salvation Army in London. For many years, Barbara and her siblings have been estranged from their father, Andrew Undershaft, who now reappears as a rich and successful munitions maker. Undershaft, the father, gives money to the Salvation Army, offending Major Barbara, who does not want to be connected to his ""tainted"" wealth. However, the father argues that poverty is a worse problem than munitions, and claims that he is doing more to help society by giving his workers jobs and a steady income than Major Barbara is doing to help them by giving them bread and soup. The play script reprises several typical ""Shavian"" moves in lacking apostrophes on contractions and other punctuation, by having a didactic introductory essay explaining the play's themes, and by bending some rules of play scripting for literary purposes; for example, two characters are listed as ""The Woman"" and ""The Man"" before Shaw gives them names, for dramatic effect. As well, lines in dialect English are written phonetically (Bill Walker jeers, ""Wot prawce selvytion nah?"", ""What price salvation now?""). (wikipedia.org)",N/A,N/A,en

Crime Prevention and Community Safety,"['Gordon Hughes', 'Eugene McLaughlin', 'John Muncie']",2002-03-28,['Political Science'],"`This text represents a major contribution to the literature on crime prevention and community safety. It goes beyond existing literature in bringing together sophisticated theoretical analysis on these topics which are core issues for government at local as well as national levels. And it also brings a much needed international perspective to our understanding of the local governance of crime' - Kevin Stenson, Professor of Criminology, Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College Crime Prevention and Community Safety provides an essential introduction to the complex issues and debates in the field of crime control and the new politics of safety and security across the globe. Collectively the contributions to this volume present a critique of current policy and open up the field of study to new directions. While engaging with the dominant focus on `what works' in crime reduction and community safety, the book also moves beyond the traditionally narrow, technical boundaries of much previous debate. Crime Prevention and Community Safety: New Directions looks at: -The relationship between crime control, communities and the nation state; -The diverse and changing sites of conflict, compromise and collusion around crime control policies; -Wider issues relating to `risk', 'safety' and `security'. The central feature of the volume as a whole is a commitment to exploring new directions for research and analysis, theoretically, empirically and comparatively. In opening up the varying and volatile spaces for crime prevention and community safety within the more general politics of social order, the book provides a critical rethinking of traditional connections between criminology, social policy and politics. Crime Prevention and Community Safety will be essential reading for students of criminology, criminal justice, community safety, socio-legal studies, sociology of crime and deviance and social policy.

The Dynamiter,['Robert Louis Stevenson'],1984,['Fiction'],"Three bored men, down to their last few pennies, vow to go out into London's streets and pursue whichever adventure befalls them. What ensues is a series of remarkable stories in which the protagonists encounter several characters who may or may not be conspirators in a bombing plot on behalf of Irish independence. The characters weave intriguing and troubling tales of their histories. The chapters stand alone as adventures, but the whole is tied together nicely in the end. There is a strong satirical bent throughout the book, but some of the stories carry hidden political punches as well. The relationship of the various characters is mysterious, yet Stevenson does little to perpetuate the mystery. He is more concerned with the storytelling, and that storytelling is terrific. More than that, I dare not write, as details would quickly expose the interconnected aspects of the stories. Suffice to say that in a book about British wanderers, Stevenson manages to tell tales of murderous Mormons, crazed Voodoo practitioners, and wayward Bohemian princes, among others.",N/A,N/A,en

"The Hidden History of Crime, Corruption, and States",['Renate Bridenthal'],2017-06,['History'],"Renowned historical sociologist Charles Tilly wrote many years ago that “banditry, piracy, gangland rivalry, policing, and war-making all belong on the same continuum.” This volume pursues the idea by revealing how lawbreakers and lawmakers have related to one another on the shadowy terrains of power over wide stretches of time and space. Illicit activities and forces have been more important in state building and state maintenance than conventional histories have acknowledged. Covering vast chronological and global terrain, this book traces the contested and often overlapping boundaries between these practices in such very different polities as the pre-modern city-states of Europe, the modern nation-states of France and Japan, the imperial power of Britain in India and North America, Africa’s and Southeast Asia’s postcolonial states, and the emerging postmodern regional entity of the Mediterranean Sea.

Pornography and Sexual Aggression,"['Neil M. Malamuth', 'Edward I. Donnerstein']",1984-10-28,['Business & Economics'],"Pornography and Sexual Aggression is an analysis of the various facets of pornography and sexual aggression and possible linkages between them. This 11-chapter work focuses on the causes of male aggression against women that may or may not occur within a sexual context, as well as on possible causes of sexual aggression that are not directly related to pornography. After a historical perspective on pornography research, this book goes on presenting the findings of a series of experimental studies that primarily focuses on the effects of violent or aggressive pornography fantasies, attitudes, beliefs, and aggressive behavior. The role of such factors as individual differences in aggressive inclinations, emotional states, and situational inhibitions in mediating the impact of aggressive pornography is also examined. These topics are followed by discussions of the ability of a theoretical model based on physiological arousal and emotional reactions, as well as the various individual difference variables that may affect reactions to pornography. Other chapters review the correlational data both within the United States and other areas of the world, along with some psychological and communicative factors that may cause sexual aggression. The concluding chapters describe the implications for legal change of some of the research, particularly on violent pornography. This book will prove useful to psychologists, psychiatrists, and behaviorists.",N/A,N/A,en

Our Dark Side,['Elisabeth Roudinesco'],2009-11-02,['History'],"Where does perversion begin? Who is perverse? Ever since the word first appeared in the Middle Ages, anyone who delights in evil and in the destruction of the self or others has been described as 'perverse'. But while the experience of perversion is universal, every era has seen it and dealt with it in its own way. The history of perversion in the West is told here through a study of great emblematic figures of the perverse - Gilles de Rais, the mystical saints and the flagellants in the middle ages, the Marquis de Sade in the eighteenth century, the masturbating child, the male homosexual and the hysterical woman nineteenth century, Nazism in the twentieth century, and the complementary figures of the paedophile and the terrorist in the twenty-first. The perverse are rarely talked about and when they are it is usually only to be condemned. They are commonly viewed as monstrous and cruel, as something alien to the very nature of being human. And yet, perversion can also attest to creativity and self-transcendence, to the refusal of individuals to submit to the rules and prohibitions that govern human life. Perversion fascinates us precisely because it can be both abject and sublime. Whether they are sublime because they turn to art or mysticism, or abject because they surrender to their murderous impulses, the perverse are part of us because they exhibit something that we always conceal: our own negativity and our dark side.",5,N/A,en

"Crime, Shame, and Reintegration",['John Braithwaite'],1989,['Social Science'],"Crime, Shame and Reintegration is a contribution to general criminological theory. Its approach is as relevant to professional burglary as to episodic delinquency or white collar crime. Braithwaite argues that some societies have higher crime rates than others because of their different processes of shaming wrongdoing. Shaming can be counterproductive, making crime problems worse. But when shaming is done within a cultural context of respect for the offender, it can be an extraordinarily powerful, efficient and just form of social control. Braithwaite identifies the social conditions for such successful shaming. If his theory is right, radically different criminal justice policies are needed - a shift away from punitive social control toward greater emphasis on moralizing social control. This book will be of interest not only to criminologists and sociologists, but to those in law, public administration and politics who are concerned with social policy and social issues.",N/A,N/A,en

Rather it evidently served the more sinister purpose -- for a privileged ruling class -- of forcing the poor population of London to accept the criminalization of customary rights and new forms of private property. Necessity drove the city's poor into inevitable conflict with the changing property laws such that all the working-class men and women of London had good reason to fear the example of Tyburn's triple tree.In this new edition Peter Linebaugh reinforces his original arguments with responses to his critics based on an impressive array of historical sources.

Eventually, once he has settled into his new life, the CIA will leak his whereabouts to the Israelis, the Russians, the Chinese and the Saudis.

Children in Danger,['James Garbarino'],1992,['Psychology'],"""Childhood is ideally a time of safety, marked by freedom from the economic, sexual, and political demands that later become part of adult life. For many children, however, particularly those who live in our inner cities, childhood is increasingly a time of danger. The urban war zones of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington. D.C., are not unlike the war zones of Beirut, Belfast, and Mozambique. In both worlds, children grow up with firsthand knowledge of terror and violence. This book examines the threat to childhood development posed by living amid chronic community violence. It shows caregiving adults such as teachers, psychologists, social workers, and counselors how they can work together to help children while they are still children--before they become angry, aggressive adults."" ""Drawing on their extensive fieldwork in war zones around the world, the authors explore the link between a child's response to growing up in an atmosphere of violence and danger, and the social context established for that child by community and caregivers. They reveal the need for establishing predictable, structured, safe environments for children and they show how school-based programs, by providing children with the continuity and regularity that is otherwise lacking in their lives, can enhance children's natural resilience and help ameliorate some of the long-term developmental consequences of living in danger. In addition to providing firsthand accounts of how children growing up in an atmosphere of violence address their situations, the authors also examine the special concerns that relate to the training and support of teachers who deal not only with the violence in the lives of the children they teach, but also with their own personal safety and emotional response to their students' traumas.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

The Crimes of Women in Early Modern Germany,['Ulinka Rublack'],2001,['History'],"'The Crimes of Women in Early Modern Germany' is a fascinating study of 'deviant' women. It is the first scholarly account of how women were prosecuted for theft, infanticide, and sexual crimes in early modern Germany, and challenges the assumption that women were treated more leniently than men. Ulinka Rublack uses criminal trials to illuminate the social status and conflicts of women living through the Reformation and Thirty Years War, telling, for the first time, the stories of cutpurses, maidservants' dangerous liaisons, and artisans' troubled marriages. She provides a thought-provoking analysis of labelling and sentencing processes, and of the punishments inflicted on those found guilty. Above all, she brilliantly engages with the way 'ordinary' women experienced authority and sexuality, household and community.",N/A,N/A,en

Best American Crime Writing,['Nicholas Pileggi'],2002,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"A riveting new anthology series—a year’s worth of the most powerful, the most startling, the smartest and most astute, in short, the best crime journalism. Scouring hundreds of publications, guest editor Nicholas Pileggi, and series editors Otto Penzler and Thomas H. Cook have created a remarkable compilation of the best examples of the most current and vibrant of our literary traditions: crime reporting. Ranging in style from Mark Singer’s ribald “The Chicken Warriors,” an up-close look at the tawdry, wildly popular, illegal world of cock-fighting, to David McClintick’s harrowing “Fatal Bondage,” the tale of a grifter with an attraction to sado-masochistic sex and serial killing, this collection showcases the wide variety of writing in the field today. Criminal behavior itself also falls into a spectrum, from the isolated and idiosyncratic misdeed, such as that documented in Skip Hollandsworth’s “The Killing of Alydar,” an investigation into the greed that spawned the killing of a thoroughbred horse, to the large-scale malignancies that can shake an entire nation, as recounted in “The Day of the Attack,” Nancy Gibbs’s sobering retelling of the events of September 11, 2001. Good crime writing is never just about the crime or the criminals, so this collection also has moving and often troubling portraits of the victims, their families, and the communities in which they lived, and, in pieces such as D. Graham Burnett’s “Anatomy of a Verdict,” a reminder of the immensely difficult process that is coming to judgment. Entertaining, at times alarming, Best American Crime Writing is compelling evidence of the furthest reaches of human behavior.",N/A,N/A,en

The first story, “Fisherman,” is about a man who recovers the bodies of young boys from the village pond so that the police can pass them off as victims of drowning. “Knife,” on the other hand, is a tongue-in-cheek account of the liminal cultural world of West Bengal, which borders Bangladesh. A young woman makes her own protest against an exploitative establishment as a result of abuse by a politician and his cohorts in “Body.” An unemployed middle-class youth discovers himself after his first “test” killing in the dark story “Killer.” This collection of fascinating and unsettling stories is anchored by an in-depth introductory essay by cultural historian Sumanta Banerjee who has firsthand familiarity with the settings and situations from his crime-reporting past.
