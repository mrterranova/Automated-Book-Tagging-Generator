Provenance and Annotation of Data,['Luc Moreau'],2006-09-27,['Business & Economics'],"This book constitutes the thoroughly referred post-proceedings of the International Provenance and Annotation Workshops, IPAW 2006, held in Chicago, Il, USA in May 2006. The 26 revised full papers presented together with two keynote papers were carefully selected for presentation during two rounds of reviewing and improvement. The papers are organized in topical sections.",N/A,N/A,en
Education and Informatics Worldwide,['Jacques Hebenstreit'],1992,['Education'],"The micro computer has had a revolutionary impact on many aspects of society though its success has not been universal and unrestricted. This book looks at the current use of information technology in education and examines why the main objectives behind its introduction in this area have not been achieved. The various political, social and economic reasons behind the failure to maximize the use of informatics are examined on the one hand whilst, on the other, basic strategies and prescriptions are outlined for seizing the opportunities which will be presented by the availability of cheaper, more accessible technology in the future. One chapter describes in detail the situation in seven different regions, presenting the needs, possibilities, obstacles and prospects in each one. Finally, the book draws on the trends and issues that have emerged from previous experience in the planning and implementation of national policies to make proposals for improving the practices of international co-operation by using the full potential of informatics.",N/A,N/A,en
Manual of Food Irradiation Dosimetry,['International Atomic Energy Agency'],1977,['Science'],"Abstract: A manual for food processing plant operators presents and discusses the basic problems relevant to the dosimetry of food irradiation, treating dosimetry in sufficient practical and theoretical detail to enable technical staff to make any requisite dosimetric measurements. The material is organized among 5 major areas: (1) the basics of dosimetry (measuring absorbed doses; the physical aspects of radiation absorption; dosimetry systems and guidelines); (2) characteristics of irradiators (design criteria; radiation source selection; specific irradiator designs; practical designs); (3) dose-distribution patterns in large-scale irradiators and dose-distribution measurements); (4) the control of irradiation processing conditions in plant operation; and (5) detailed protocols for using different dose-meter systems (including, specific standardized procedures, the calibration of spectrophotometers, and the characteristics of other possibly useful dosimetry systems). Numerous illustrations and expamples are presented throughout the manual, and literature references and an expanded glossary are appended. (wz.",N/A,N/A,en

IPC for Modular Software Requires a Third Party Connect,"['Stuart Arthur Friedberg', 'ROCHESTER UNIV NY DEPT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE.']",1987,['Data'],"Reconfiguration, on-line maintenance, load balancing, and similar operations on complex software require (among other things) dynamic binding of communicating peers, so that modules can be installed and removed in a frame-work of other functional modules. A binding may take the form of TCP/IP protocol connection, remote procedure call server location, shared memory address resolution, or object handle resolution, depending on the underlying communication mechanism. However, the need for abstraction and modularity is independent of the particular IPC mechanism(s) being used. A module should not need to know how it is used (specifically, how it is bound together with other modules to implement a more complex function). Therefore, the bindings between two modules A and B should in general be created and destroyed by a third module C. We call this facility a third party connect. The module C should not have to have any particular relationship (other than authentication) to modules A and B in order to dynamically connect and disconnect them. In particular, it should not have to be one of A and B, be a common ancestor of them, or have an existing binding to them. Similarly, neither A nor B should have to take an active part in establishing or tearing down bindings.",N/A,N/A,en
