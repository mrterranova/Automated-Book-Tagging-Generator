Education and Informatics Worldwide,['Jacques Hebenstreit'],1992,['Education'],"The micro computer has had a revolutionary impact on many aspects of society though its success has not been universal and unrestricted. This book looks at the current use of information technology in education and examines why the main objectives behind its introduction in this area have not been achieved. The various political, social and economic reasons behind the failure to maximize the use of informatics are examined on the one hand whilst, on the other, basic strategies and prescriptions are outlined for seizing the opportunities which will be presented by the availability of cheaper, more accessible technology in the future. One chapter describes in detail the situation in seven different regions, presenting the needs, possibilities, obstacles and prospects in each one. Finally, the book draws on the trends and issues that have emerged from previous experience in the planning and implementation of national policies to make proposals for improving the practices of international co-operation by using the full potential of informatics.",N/A,N/A,en

Big Data,"['Nathan Marz', 'James Warren']",2015,['Computers'],"Summary Big Data teaches you to build big data systems using an architecture that takes advantage of clustered hardware along with new tools designed specifically to capture and analyze web-scale data. It describes a scalable, easy-to-understand approach to big data systems that can be built and run by a small team. Following a realistic example, this book guides readers through the theory of big data systems, how to implement them in practice, and how to deploy and operate them once they're built. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Book Web-scale applications like social networks, real-time analytics, or e-commerce sites deal with a lot of data, whose volume and velocity exceed the limits of traditional database systems. These applications require architectures built around clusters of machines to store and process data of any size, or speed. Fortunately, scale and simplicity are not mutually exclusive. Big Data teaches you to build big data systems using an architecture designed specifically to capture and analyze web-scale data. This book presents the Lambda Architecture, a scalable, easy-to-understand approach that can be built and run by a small team. You'll explore the theory of big data systems and how to implement them in practice. In addition to discovering a general framework for processing big data, you'll learn specific technologies like Hadoop, Storm, and NoSQL databases. This book requires no previous exposure to large-scale data analysis or NoSQL tools. Familiarity with traditional databases is helpful. What's Inside Introduction to big data systems Real-time processing of web-scale data Tools like Hadoop, Cassandra, and Storm Extensions to traditional database skills About the Authors Nathan Marz is the creator of Apache Storm and the originator of the Lambda Architecture for big data systems.

The Mathematical Field,['Vincent J. Hyde'],2023-03-06,[],"While writing this book, I felt intuitively that readers would want to know whether the Creator knew about the Mathematical Field. I have answered the question in one section of this book. Unfortunately, I do not know whether you will agree with me because as I mention in the book, human beings have free will. The book shows the beauty and purity of the Mathematical Field, particularly how the numbers follow specific rules to form different systems like Binary, Octal, Decimal, Duodecimal, and Hexadecimal, where they can have different place values. It is significant that the decimal system suits human beings and our design of 10 fingers and 10 toes for counting seems to be no accident. The rules of the decimal system allows the numbers to be easily added, subtracted, multiplied and divided. Even the higher functions of calculating square roots, cube roots, Sine, Cosine, Tan, logarithms, and exponentials can be easily calculated using a simple calculating machine. The numbers form sequences and series. The arithmetic and geometric series enable easy calculation of numbers using formulae. All the periodic functions like Sine, Cosine, Tan, and ex can be expressed as a series. The Algebraic Arm has shown us how lines and curves can be expressed as simple equations, which we can visualise on the Cartesian Plane in two dimensions. Through differentiation and integration, we can sketch curves and calculate areas and volumes. In the Geometric Arm, we can visualise the points forming lines and the lines forming different slopes and different angles. Geometry also shows the different formations the lines can take-three lines to form triangles, four lines to form quadrilaterals, five lines to form pentagons, and many other shapes with more lines. Geometry also shows the purity of the conic sections forming hyperbolas, ellipses, parabolas, and circles with specific equations and characteristics that enable them to be easily sketched. The manner in which the two foci of the ellipse can come together to form the beautiful circle with one centre and one radius is amazing. Although the Cartesian Plane is more of an algebraic way of showing points in terms of x and y coordinates from an origin of (0,0), the Geometric Arm has shown that points can be described geometrically, as a distance and an angle from an origin. Geometry has also shown us how points around a circle can be drawn as Sine and Cosine waves, which generate the numerous trigonometric identities. The Mathematical Field shows the importance of measurements, which has led to standardisation and mass production of goods and services. This has obviously made things easy for the large populations supported in the cities and towns all over the world. The Mathematical Field has also made it possible to draw and design objects before manufacture and construction; this eliminates errors and wastage. Numbers are essentially pure producing the same results when put in equations and formulae. Human beings and the Fields of Knowledge can produce uncertain results because of the free will issue. Mathematics allows for this in Probability Theory, a branch of Arithmetic Arm. The Sporting Field is full of probability associated with the results. If five horses are running in a race, there is only a certain probability that a particular horse will win. Also, if one tossed a coin, there is only a 50% chance of getting a head and a 50% chance of not getting a head. Probability Theory shows how to calculate the chances of certain events occurring. Finally, the Mathematical Field shows us how to sort the data accumulated in many of Fields of Knowledge to produce useful statistical data and generate formulae and applications in many other Fields of Knowledge, some of which will be considered in my next book.",N/A,N/A,en

Data collection and compilation can be enhanced by adoption of format standards which define guidelines for common terminology, documentation of performance measurement for both metals and nonmetals, data output and presentation, and for assessing data quality. Well-defined programs, using a variety of established computerization techniques, can serve as effective tools for selection of corrosion resistant materials, assessing material limitations, selection and design of corrosion control methods, and for gaining a better understanding of the significance and theoretical considerations relating to operative corrosion mechanisms.",N/A,N/A,en

Data Center 2.0,['Rien Dijkstra'],2014-06-09,[],"Data Center 2.0: The Sustainable Data Center is an in-depth look into the steps needed to transform modern-day data centers into sustainable entities. A sustainable data center should be environmentally viable, economically equitable, and socially bearable. Creating sustainable data centers is not a technical problem but an economic problem to be solved. This book takes a conceptual approach to the subject of data centers and sustainability. It offers at least multiple views and aspects on sustainable data centers to allow readers to gain a better understanding and provoke thoughts on how to create sustainable data centers. ""Data Center 2.0, is not so much about technology but about people, society and economic development. By helping readers understand that even if Data Centers, enabling the Digital economy, are contributing a lot to energy saving, they need to be sustainable themselves; Rien Dijkstra is on the right track. When explaining how to build sustainable Data Centers, through multi disciplinary approach, breaking the usual silos of the different expertise, Rien Dijkstra is proposing the change of behavior needed to build sustainable Data Centers. Definitely it is about people, not technology."" Paul-Francois Cattier Global Senior Vice-President Data Center - Schneider Electric “In Data Center 2.0 The Sustainable Data Center author Rien Dijkstra has gone several steps further in viewing the data center from the perspective of long term ownership and efficiency in combination with treating it as a system. It's an excellent read with many sections that could be extracted and utilized in their own right. I highly recommend this read for IT leaders who are struggling with the questions of whether to add capacity (co-locate, buy, build, or lease) or how to create a stronger organizational ownership model for existing data center capacity. The questions get more complex every year and the risks more serious for the business. The fact that you're making a business critical decision that must stand the test of technology and business change over 15 years is something you shouldn't take lightly.” Mark Thiele President and Founder Data Center Pulse “Data centers used to be buildings to house computer servers along with network and storage systems, a physical manifestation of the Digital Economy. Internet of Things, the digitization of about everything in and around us, brings many profound changes. A data center is the place where it all comes together. Physical and digital life, fueled by energy and IT, economical and social demands and needs and not to forget sustainability considerations. Sustainable data centers have a great potential to help society to optimize the use of resources and to eliminate or reduce wastes of capital, human labor and energy. A data center in that sense is much more than just a building for servers. It has become a new business model. Data center 2.0 is a remarkable book that describes the steps and phases to facilitate and achieve this paradigm.” John Post Managing Director - Foundation Green IT Amsterdam region",N/A,N/A,en

This study finds evidence that participation in small and medium enterprise programs is associated with improvements in key variables such as value added, gross production, and wages. Furthermore, the study finds evidence that some of the positive effects can take several years to realize.

IPC for Modular Software Requires a Third Party Connect,"['Stuart Arthur Friedberg', 'ROCHESTER UNIV NY DEPT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE.']",1987,['Data'],"Reconfiguration, on-line maintenance, load balancing, and similar operations on complex software require (among other things) dynamic binding of communicating peers, so that modules can be installed and removed in a frame-work of other functional modules. A binding may take the form of TCP/IP protocol connection, remote procedure call server location, shared memory address resolution, or object handle resolution, depending on the underlying communication mechanism. However, the need for abstraction and modularity is independent of the particular IPC mechanism(s) being used. A module should not need to know how it is used (specifically, how it is bound together with other modules to implement a more complex function). Therefore, the bindings between two modules A and B should in general be created and destroyed by a third module C. We call this facility a third party connect. The module C should not have to have any particular relationship (other than authentication) to modules A and B in order to dynamically connect and disconnect them.

The Use of SGML for Retrieval of Chemical Data,"['KT. Barry', 'PL. Kienlen', 'JD. Mason', 'RA. Strehlow', 'TO. Tallant']",1994,['Chemistry'],"The encoding of information within a document using Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) permits a novel approach to direct retrieval of data from documents. Although SGML is designed primarily for electronic interchange of texts, its features have been found to be useful in the management of data contained within a document. Encoding can include scientific and technical information, as well as associated and ancillary data, management data, and other metadata. This paper describes and gives examples of the use of the technique with special reference to chemical data. Examples of tags used in documents are shown. Retrieval of contained information is conventionally done by means of searches to retrieve a set of documents that have a probability of containing the desired information. The method described here uses a radically different approach to the information retrieval problem.",N/A,N/A,en

The Role of Brain Drain on Africa's Development,['Oluwatosin Emmanuel Folowosele'],2021,['African studies'],"This economic literature research emerged as evidence on the impact of Brain Drain (Skilled Workers) as a critical role in developing countries. In this paper, we tested emigration panel data estimations for a sample of all Sub-Saharan African countries. Our empirical strategy plan employs the Fixed Effect and Random Effect regression analysis techniques on a unique model. We utilized a dataset of 43 Sub-Saharan African countries between 2004-2015. We show that economic down in most African countries is likely to cause increases in Brain Drain turnover in the region. Additionally, our panel data tested the wide range of diminishing returns and the prediction model of emigration rates in this region. The estimated cross-region findings in this region of the combined effects increase on Brain Drain have caused a frequency of prone economies. However, the main cause for the present poverty in the region is due to poor African political specifications.",N/A,N/A,en

Use of Abstraction in Creating Data Dictionaries for Materials Data Banks,['PM. Sargent'],1991,['Abstraction'],"Construction of all databases requires an underlying ""data model,"" either implicit or explicit. The different options for data models for materials property data are an appropriate subject for standardization because they require agreed specifications for the formats of catalogs, data dictionaries, or thesauri. An understanding of these underlying data models is also crucial in deriving useful and flexible data interchange formats. This paper shows that a ""layered"" approach in constructing data dictionaries can be helpful both in setting up databases and in defining interchange formats.",N/A,N/A,en

Data Measures that Characterise Classification Problems,['Christiaan Maarten Van der Walt'],2005,[],"We have a wide-range of classifiers today that are employed in numerous applications, from credit scoring to speech-processing, with great technical and commercial success. No classifier, however, exists that will outperform all other classifiers on all classification tasks, and the process of classifier selection is still mainly one of trial and error. The optimal classifier for a classification task is determined by the characteristics of the data set employed: understanding the relationship between data characteristics and the performance of classifiers is therefore crucial to the process of classifier selection. Empirical and theoretical approaches have been employed in the literature to define this relationship. None of these approaches have, however, been very successful in accurately predicting or explaining classifier performance on real-world data. We use theoretical properties of classifiers to identify data characteristics that influence classifier performance: these data properties guide us in the development of measures that describe the relationship between data characteristics and classifier performance. We employ these data measures on real-world and artificial data to construct a meta-classification system. We use theoretical properties of classifiers to identify data characteristics that influence classifier performance: these data properties guide us in the development of measures that describe the relationship between data characteristics and classifier performance. We employ these data measures on real-world and artificial data to construct a meta-classification system. The purpose of this meta-classifier is two-fold: (1) to predict the classification performance of real-world classification tasks, and (2) to explain these predictions in order to gain insight into the properties of real-world data. We show that these data measures can be employed successfully to predict the classification performance of real-world data sets: these predictions are accurate in some instances but there is still unpredictable behaviour in other instances. We illustrate that these data measures can give valuable insight into the properties and data structures of real-world data: these insights are extremely valuable for high-dimensional classification problems.",N/A,N/A,en

Reporting and Evaluating Stress Corrosion Data,['D. O. Sprowls'],1967,['Aluminum alloys'],"Susceptibility of a metal to stress corrosion implies a greater deterioration of its mechanical properties through the simultaneous action of a static stress and exposure to a corrosive environment than would be produced by the combined effects of each factor operating separately. In recent years this point of view on stress corrosion and stress corrosion cracking (the ultimate in stress corrosion) has become widely recognized. However, confusion still exists, with the result that some work is published that has little value because of the poor design of testing procedure. It is still sometimes erroneously assumed that failure of a specimen under stress corrosion test conditions suffices to demonstrate susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking. This conclusion is unjustified, for the specimen may have become so weakened by corrosion, even without any acceleration by stress, as to fail under the applied load. Thus, it is most essential to select techniques (type of specimen and method of loading, test medium and period of exposure) that produce failure that is purely the result of stress corrosion cracking. Because of the marked effect that test procedure can have upon ordinary criteria, such as specimen life, percentage of specimen survival, threshold stress, etc., investigators should report details of procedure and technique as well as detailed data along with their analysis of the results. This is necessary to enable the reviewer to adapt the information to his need and to make possible a reanalysis of the data by some method that may be developed in the future.",N/A,N/A,en

An Approach to Laboratory Data Management,['TW. May'],1988,['Application program'],"A programmable data base, capable of generating complex application programs with management personnel, was investigated in order to facilitate the documentation requirements of Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS). Emphasis was placed on developing a system that would be adaptable at the small independent laboratory level, that is, one that was limited in funds available for computerization and without high-level programming expertise. A successful system was developed around an enhanced IBM PC (XT) with the following software: the Sensible Solution relational data base, Volkswriter 3.0 word processor, and the Labcode-QC statistical quality control system. Application programs were developed as part of a total sample and data tracking system that featured distinct data categories: laboratory/field collection preparation methods or both; sample batch history; sample inventory listing; laboratory homogenization methods; chemical preparation methods; instrumental methods; final reports and other documents; current sample status; chemical, stock, and standard catalogue; control material catalogue; instrument service log; instrument/equipment calibration; personnel monthly time tracking. The system was developed easily without the expertise of experienced programmers and can be modified readily when needed.",N/A,N/A,en

Osborne'],1999,['Data'],"Crucial to the success of Contract 102 of the Jubilee Line Extension Project (JLEP) was the detailed analysis of the impact of the construction process on the surrounding ground, structures and tunnels under construction. The construction works were to pass under or alongside some of London's most historic and prestigious buildings, consequently stringent limits were imposed upon ground and structure movements. To control these movements and remain within the limits set, a comprehensive monitoring system was required, comprising a wide variety of instruments linked to a geotechnical database. An extensive and integrated instrumentation system was designed to produce quality data and as no monitoring system existed that covered the unique requirements of the contract and of the Balfour Beatty Amec Joint Venture (BBA), the option was taken by BBA to design and develop a system in house.",N/A,N/A,en
