The Modern Rise of Population,['Thomas McKeown'],1976,['Medical'],"""One of the truly important books of our time."" The modern rise of population is one of the great themes of history. Ten thousand years ago thee were less than 10 million people in the world. By 1750 there were 750 million and, from that time to the present, the growth has continued at a rapid and ever advancingrate. World population reached 1,000 million in 1830, 2,000 million a century later, and today exceeds 4,000 million. Although the phenomenon has received considerable attention, interest has centered on its iplications for the future and the causes have been neglected. This study rights the balance. The approach is both novel and comprehensive, and the conclusions are controversial. The author challenges manu common assumptions and argues, for instance, that the health of man 'is only marginally influenced by personal medical care'. Notable for its grasp of complex and biological and medical issues and for its lucid style, this is a thorough interpretation of a subject which must concern us all."" -- Publisher description.",N/A,N/A,en

Evolution of the Human Diet,['Peter S. Ungar'],2007,['Health & Fitness'],"We are interested in the evolution of hominin diets for several reasons. One is the fundamental concern over our present-day eating habits and the consequences of our societal choices, such as obesity prevalent in some cultures and starvation in others. Another is that humans have learned to feed themselves in extremely varied environments, and these adaptations, which are fundamentally different from those of our closest biological relatives, have to have had historical roots of varying depth. The third, and the reason why most paleoanthropologists are interested in this question, is that a species' trophic level and feeding adaptations can have a strong effect on body size, locomotion, ""life history strategies"", geographic range, habitat choice, and social behavior. Diet is key to understanding the ecology and evolution of our distant ancestors and their kin, the early hominins. A study of the range of foods eaten by our progenitors underscores just how unhealthy many of our diets are today. This volume brings together authorities from disparate fields to offer new insights into the diets of our ancestors. Paleontologists, archaeologists, primatologists, nutritionists and other researchers all contribute pieces to the puzzle. This volume has at its core four main sections: · Reconstructed diets based on hominin fossils--tooth size, shape, structure, wear, and chemistry, mandibular biomechanics · Archaeological evidence of subsistence--stone tools and modified bones · Models of early hominin diets based on the diets of living primates--both human and non-human, paleoecology, and energetics · Nutritional analyses and their implications for evolutionary medicine New techniques for gleaning information from fossil teeth, bones, and stone tools, new theories stemming from studies of paleoecology, and new models coming from analogy with modern humans and other primates all contribute to our understanding. When these approaches are brought together, they offer an impressive glimpse into the lives of our distant ancestors. The contributions in this volume explore the frontiers of our knowledge in each of these disciplines as they address the knowns, the unknowns, and the unknowables of the evolution of hominin diets.",N/A,N/A,en

Diet for a Large Planet,['Chris Otter'],2023-06-05,['History'],"""In this magisterial study, Chris Otter traces Britain's transition to a diet rich in animal proteins and refined carbohydrates like wheat and sugar, a diet that required more acreage than that of Britain itself and that, if followed everywhere, would soon deplete the planet's resources-as the title announces, this was truly a ""diet for a large planet."" From the late 1700s to the end of World War II, Otter accounts for the structures, practices, and ideologies generated by Britain's nutrition transition. He shows how Britain was the first nation to undergo the population explosion, urbanization, and industrialization we associate with modernity, and how it managed the unprecedented problem of how to feed its growing population. Its radical solution would be to outsource its food production, leading away from a locally produced, plant-based diet to one reliant on global markets, international trade networks, and enormous agro-food systems that would have planetary effects on famine, war, the world economy, and the wider earth-system. Not only did this phase in Britain's history make the consumption of meat, white bread, sugar, and butter a coveted diet, linked to development, luxury, and power--it also opened up a new phase in economic history, one whose dramatic effects endure to this day, whether in terms of health problems, eating disorders, or the seemingly endless world food crisis""--",N/A,N/A,en

This book is both timely and significant because nutritionists and health care professionals are seldom aware of anthropological information on these food practices, and vice versa.

Shelley and the Revolution in Taste,['Timothy Morton'],1994,['Literary Criticism'],"This book brings together the themes of diet, consumption, the body, and human relationships with the natural world, in a highly original study of Shelley.

The book is at once grounded in the revolutionary history of the period 1790-1820, and informed by current theoretical issues and anthropological and sociological approaches to literature. Morton provides challenging new readings of much-debated poems, plays, and novels by both Percy and Mary Shelley, as well as the first sustained interpretation of Shelley's prose on diet. With its stimulating literary-historical reassessment of questions about nature and culture, this study will provoke fresh discussion about Shelley, Romanticism, and modernity.",N/A,N/A,en

Dinner with Darwin,['Jonathan Silvertown'],2017-09-05,['Cooking'],"What do eggs, flour, and milk have in common? They form the basis of crepes of course, but they also each have an evolutionary purpose. Eggs, seeds (from which flour is derived by grinding) and milk are each designed by evolution to nourish offspring. Everything we eat has an evolutionary history. Grocery shelves and restaurant menus are bounteous evidence of evolution at work, though the label on the poultry will not remind us of this with a Jurassic sell-by date, nor will the signs in the produce aisle betray the fact that corn has a 5,000 year history of artificial selection by pre-Colombian Americans. Any shopping list, each recipe, every menu and all ingredients can be used to create culinary and gastronomic magic, but can also each tell a story about natural selection, and its influence on our plates--and palates. Join in for multiple courses, for a tour of evolutionary gastronomy that helps us understand the shape of our diets, and the trajectories of the foods that have been central to them over centuries--from spirits to spices. This literary repast also looks at the science of our interaction with foods and cooking--the sights, the smells, the tastes. The menu has its eclectic components, just as any chef is entitled. But while it is not a comprehensive work which might risk gluttony, this is more than an amuse bouche, and will leave every reader hungry for more.",N/A,N/A,en

Eating,"['Peter Singer', 'Jim Mason']",2006,['Juvenile Nonfiction'],"Written with investigative vigour, provocative and controversial but always accessible, Eating is a hard-hitting exploration of our eating habits, making us look at what we eat as a moral issue. Organic foods are the fastest growing section of the food industry, and it is estimated that vegans are now almost as common as vegetarians. Veal consumption in the US has fallen by more than 75% since 1975, and in the UK, sales of free-range eggs have now passed in value sales of eggs from caged hens. Evidently we are concerned. But how concerned should we be about where our food comes from? Does the food we buy really affect the world around us? And what can we do? In Eating, philosopher Peter Singer and environmentalist Jim Mason follow three families with varying eating habits, from fast-food eaters to vegans, to explore how the food we eat makes its way to the table, and at what expense. The authors peel back each layer of food production, and examine how they ought to factor into our buying choices. Recognising that we are not all likely to become vegetarian or vegan, they go on to offer ways to make the most ethical choices within the framework of a diet that includes animal products.",N/A,N/A,en

Food in Antiquity,"['Don R. Brothwell', 'Patricia Brothwell']",1969,['Cooking'],"A world-wide survey of the eating and drinking habits of early peoples, Don and Patricia Brothwell's ""Food in Antiquity"" covers a broad geographical range, from the early populations of Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Americas to the more familiar Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, and Roman worlds. From meat, insects, vegetables, and fruits to cooking oils and beverages, each source of sustenance is described in terms of who consumed it, how it was prepared, and how it spread from its region of origin. The Brothwells' treatment is engaging and the information they provide fascinating. We learn, for example, that the vinegar carried by Roman foot soldiers on long marches was mixed with water to serve as a refreshing drink and that fungi provided a reliable source of diet for peoples from Europe, Australia, Japan, and China. The authors consider such questions as whether St. John ate carob or actual locusts in his desert hermitage and whether ancient farmers may have rid their crops of troublesome pests by capturing and eating them. They discuss cannibalism, food taboos, and the radical changes that took place with the introduction of the domestication of animals. The story they unfold is a compelling one that sheds much light on the intricate detective work, the problems and rewards, of biological research in archeology.",N/A,N/A,en

Catching Fire,['Richard W. Wrangham'],2009,['Cookery'],"In this stunningly original book, Richard Wrangham argues that it was cooking that caused the extraordinary transformation of our ancestors from apelike beings to Homo erectus. At the heart of Catching Fire lies an explosive new idea: The habit of eating cooked rather than raw food permitted the digestive tract to shrink and the human brain to grow, helped structure human society, and created the male-female division of labour. As our ancestors adapted to using fire, humans emerged as ""the cooking apes"". Covering everything from food-labelling and overweight pets to raw-food faddists, Catching Fire offers a startlingly original argument about how we came to be the social, intelligent, and sexual species we are today. ""This notion is surprising, fresh and, in the hands of Richard Wrangham, utterly persuasive ...

Nourishment,['Fred Provenza'],2018,['Health & Fitness'],"Reflections on feeding body and spirit in a world of change Animal scientists have long considered domestic livestock to be too dumb to know how to eat right, but the lifetime research of animal behaviorist Fred Provenza and his colleagues has debunked this myth. Their work shows that when given a choice of natural foods, livestock have an astoundingly refined palate, nibbling through the day on as many as fifty kinds of grasses, forbs, and shrubs to meet their nutritional needs with remarkable precision. In Nourishment Provenza presents his thesis of the wisdom body, a wisdom that links flavor-feedback relationships at a cellular level with biochemically rich foods to meet the body's nutritional and medicinal needs. Provenza explores the fascinating complexity of these relationships as he raises and answers thought-provoking questions about what we can learn from animals about nutritional wisdom. What kinds of memories form the basis for how herbivores, and humans, recognize foods? Can a body develop nutritional and medicinal memories in utero and early in life? Do humans still possess the wisdom to select nourishing diets? Or, has that ability been hijacked by nutritional ""authorities""? Consumers eager for a ""quick fix"" have empowered the multibillion-dollar-a-year supplement industry, but is taking supplements and enriching and fortifying foods helping us, or is it hurting us? On a broader scale Provenza explores the relationships among facets of complex, poorly understood, ever-changing ecological, social, and economic systems in light of an unpredictable future. To what degree do we lose contact with life-sustaining energies when the foods we eat come from anywhere but where we live? To what degree do we lose the mythological relationship that links us physically and spiritually with Mother Earth who nurtures our lives? Provenza's paradigm-changing exploration of these questions has implications that could vastly improve our health through a simple change in the way we view our relationships with the plants and animals we eat. Our health could be improved by eating biochemically rich foods and by creating cultures that know how to combine foods into meals that nourish and satiate. Provenza contends the voices of ""authority"" disconnect most people from a personal search to discover the inner wisdom that can nourish body and spirit. That journey means embracing wonder and uncertainty and avoiding illusions of stability and control as we dine on a planet in a universe bent on consuming itself.",N/A,N/A,en

Yin Yang Diet,['Ken Babal'],2019-03-26,['Health & Fitness'],"The Yin-Yang Diet is a modern, scientific approach to balanced nutrition based on the ancient Asian concept of Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang describe how opposites or contrary forces are interconnected, interdependent and complimentary. The book explains the Yin or Yang nature of foods and nutrients and how they affect our constantly changing body chemistry. A diet that is too extreme in either Yin or Yang invites disease. A diet that is balanced in Yin and Yang creates metabolic health and harmony. On the furthest extreme of Yin are fruit, sugar and alcohol. Eggs, meat and salt are on the furthest extreme of Yang. Nutrients can also be classified as Yin or Yang. The most important mineral ratio is the potassium to sodium ratio. To be healthy, we must strike a balance between sodium (Yang) and potassium (Yin). Protein (Yang) and fat (Yin) comprise the opposite poles of our ""life battery."" The association of fat and protein represent the interaction of Yin and Yang from which energy and life is created. A key element of The Yin-Yang Diet is a protein-oil shake for regeneration of the body's cells, tissues and organs. The Yin-Yang Diet includes recommendations for adaptogenic tonic herbs. Yin tonics help with the accumulation of energy and moisture and are nourishing, moistening, cooling or anti-inflammatory. Conversely, Yang tonics help us utilize energy. Yang herbs are activating, drying, warm or hot. They are the sexual, athletic tonics, which stimulate metabolism, build muscle, reduce body fat and strengthen bones and joints. Other important Yin-Yang considerations covered are Digestion and Elimination, Acid and Alkaline, and Food and Food Abstinence. Recommendations follow each chapter. The Yin-Yang Diet goes beyond a plant-based diet, and there is no calorie counting! When you achieve Yin-Yang balance in your diet, you are on the path to what the Chinese call ""radiant health"" or ""health beyond danger."" Radiant health is the highest level of health a person can attain.",N/A,N/A,en

Beriberi in Modern Japan,['Alexander R. Bay'],2012,['History'],"The history of the medical and scientific debate about the etiology of the disease as it played out between diet theorists and contagionists from 1880 to 1940. In modern Japan, beriberi (or thiamin deficiency) became a public health problem that cut across all social boundaries, afflicting even the Meiji Emperor. During an age of empire building for the Japanese nation, incidence rates in the military ranged from 30 percent in peacetime to 90 percent during war. Doctors and public health officials called beriberi a ""national disease"" because it festered within the bodies of the people and threatened the health ofthe empire. Nevertheless, they could not agree over what caused the disease, attributing it to a diet deficiency or a microbe. In Beriberi in Modern Japan, Alexander R. Bay examines the debates over the etiologyof this ""national disease"" during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Etiological consensus came after World War I, but the struggle at the national level to direct beriberi prevention continued, peaking during wartime mobilization. War served as the context within which scientific knowledge of beriberi and its prevention was made. The story of beriberi research is not simply about the march toward the inevitable discovery of ""the beriberi vitamin,"" but rather the history of the role of medicine in state-making and empire-building in modern Japan. Alexander Bay is assistant professor of history at Chapman University.",N/A,N/A,en

Life in the Fasting Lane,"['Jason Fung', 'Eve Mayer', 'Megan Ramos']",2020-02-24,['Health & Fitness'],"Take the guesswork (and fear) out of fasting with real-life and expert advice In recent years, intermittent fasting--restricting calorie intake for a set number of hours or days--has become an increasingly popular diet strategy. While some in the medical community initially dismissed the idea as a dangerous fad, recent research not only validates the safety of fasting for weight loss but also offers compelling evidence of wide-ranging health benefits, from reversal of diabetes and other metabolic disorders to enhanced cognitive function and increased longevity. But for many who are eager to try out fasting, the regimen can feel a bit intimidating. After all, abstaining from food doesn't sound like much fun. People rightly wonder: How often can I eat? Will I be able to focus at work? Will I have enough energy to exercise? And perhaps the most concerning question of all: Won't I be hungry all the time?! Enter Dr. Jason Fung--world-renowned fasting expert--his colleague, Megan Ramos, and Eve Mayer, who has experienced the life-changing benefits of fasting through Dr. Fung's program. Together, they've teamed up to write a one-of-a-kind guide that answers the most common questions people have about fasting--and offers a customizable program that provides real results. In Life in the Fasting Lane, Dr. Fung, Ramos, and Mayer take the reader by the hand and walk them through the basics of a fasting lifestyle--from the science behind fasting as a health and weight loss strategy to the real-life choices and dilemmas people commonly encounter. While Dr. Fung and Ramos explain the fundamentals of fasting and offer a customizable approach, Mayer shares her in-the-trenches perspective and hard-won knowledge as a success story who turned her life around with fasting. With chapters that address everything from meal planning to mental strategies; exercise to socializing, Life in the Fasting Lane is a unique and accessible guide to developing a sustainable and beneficial fasting routine that offers dramatic, lifelong results.",N/A,N/A,en

What he chose to eat was intimately tied to his beliefs, and his key values of nonviolence, religious tolerance, and rural sustainability developed in tandem with his dietary experiments. His repudiation of sugar, chocolate, and salt expressed his active resistance to economies based on slavery, indentured labor, and imperialism. Gandhi's Search for the Perfect Diet sheds new light on important periods in Gandhi's life as they relate to his developing food ethic: his student years in London, his politicization as a young lawyer in South Africa, the 1930 Salt March challenging British colonialism, and his fasting as a means of self-purification and social protest during India's struggle for independence. What became the pillars of Gandhi's diet--vegetarianism, limiting salt and sweets, avoiding processed food, and fasting--anticipated many twenty-first-century food debates and the need to build healthier and more equitable global food systems.",N/A,N/A,en
First Bite,"['Beatrice Wilson', 'Bee Wilson']",2015-12-31,['Diet'],"Fortnum & Mason Food Book of the Year 2016 We are not born knowing what to eat. We all have to learn it as children sitting expectantly at a table. For our diets to change, we need to relearn the food experiences that first shaped us. Everyone starts drinking milk. After that it's all up for grabs. We are not born knowing what to eat; we each have to figure it out for ourselves. From childhood onwards, we learn how big a portion is and how sweet is too sweet. We learn to love broccoli - or not. But how does this happen? What are the origins of taste? And once we acquire our food habits, can we ever change them for the better? In First Bite, award-winning food writer Bee Wilson draws on the latest research from food psychologists, neuroscientists and nutritionists to reveal how our food habits are shaped by a whole host of factors: family and culture, memory and gender, hunger and love. She looks at the effects siblings can have on eating choices and the social pressures to eat according to sex. Bee introduces us to people who can only eat food of a certain colour; toddlers who will eat nothing but hot dogs; doctors who have found radical new ways to help children eat vegetables. First Bite also looks at how people eat in different parts of the world: we see how grandparents in China overfeed their grandchildren, and how Japan came to adopt such a healthy diet (it wasn't always so). The way we learn to eat holds the key to why food has gone so disastrously wrong for so many people. But Bee Wilson also shows that both adults and children have immense potential for learning new, healthy eating habits. An exploration of the extraordinary and surprising origins of our taste and eating habits, First Bite explains how we can change our palates to lead healthier, happier lives.",N/A,N/A,en

The Atkins Diet, The South Beach Diet, The Zone Diet, The Blood Type Diet, The Eat Clean Diet, The Alkaline Diet, The Ornish Diet, The Insert Name Here Diet.You probably lost some weight... for awhile. Did you keep it off? Chances are you didn't. In fact, chances are you regained it all back and possibly then some. You aren't alone. Six out of seven people who are overweight are able to successfully lose weight during their lifetime. But 85-95% of them will fail at keeping it off in the long term. If this sounds bad, consider that ⅓-⅔ of those people will add back on more weight than they lost in the first place! If this cycle is repeated it can turn into 'yo-yo dieting', quite possibly one of the worst things you can do for your mental and physical health.Ask anyone and they will tell you that you need to lose weight and keep it off and prevent yo-yo dieting, but no one gives you an idea of HOW to accomplish that. What makes our book different? We discuss WHY diets fail on a physiological, psychological, and sociological level so you can better understand why what you did previously did not work. Then we also detail the MOST IMPORTANT behaviors, methods, and traits for losing weight and KEEPING IT OFF.This book is for everyone who wants to lose weight and keep it off, especially for those frustrated and hopeless chronic dieters tired of trying all the popular diets only to repeatedly fail. There is still hope to be found in these pages. Please give us the chance to guide you.",N/A,N/A,en
