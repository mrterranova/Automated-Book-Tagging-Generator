The Dream-Hunter,['Sherrilyn Kenyon'],2012-04-01,['Dark-Hunter (Fictitious character)'],"In the ethereal world of dreams there are champions who fight to protect the dreamer and there are demons who prey on them. Arik is such a predator. Condemned by the gods to live for eternity without emotions, Arik can only feel when he's in the dreams of others. Now, after thousands of years, he's finally found a dreamer whose vivid mind can fill his emptiness. Dr Megeara Kafieri made a reluctant promise to her dying father that she would salvage his reputation by proving his life-long belief that Atlantis is real. But frustration and bad luck dog her every step. Especially the day they find a stranger floating in the sea. His is a face she has seen many times...in her dreams.",N/A,N/A,en
A Dream of Wessex (Valancourt 20th Century Classics),['Christopher Priest'],2016-02-02,['Fiction'],"The western democracies are disintegrating, scarred by violence and gripped with fear of terrorist attacks. Trying to find solutions to today's problems, Julia Stretton and other specialists at the Wessex Project have created a virtual reality projection of a utopian future where all current issues have been resolved - how did they achieve it? But on entering Wessex, they lose all memory of their 'real' lives outside, and as they move back and forth the lines between dream and reality become obscured. When Julia's ex-lover, the sadistic Paul Mason, joins the project, he has a sinister plan to take the Wessex projection to a new and terrifying level . . . Christopher Priest's fifth novel, A Dream of Wessex (1977), is a classic of science fiction that will keep readers guessing until the startling, mind-bending conclusion. Priest's novels The Space Machine, The Affirmation, and The Separation are also available from Valancourt. '[An] excellent and intriguing novel ... the characters and their emotions are real, the concepts fascinating, and the sense of foreboding almost unbearable.' - Library Journal 'This fine novel about time-unravellers has hallucinatory powers ... Priest is a novelist of real distinction.' - The Times (London) 'Christopher Priest is one of our most gifted young writers of science fiction. I recommend A Dream of Wessex. I can best convey its quality by saying that I think not only H.G. Wells but Thomas Hardy himself would have enjoyed and approved of it.' - John Fowles, author of The Magus 'It is a strange novel, technically very assured in its shifts of time and handling of place-in-time, sketching in the edges of the dream with considerable vividness. A fine, exciting novel - SF if you want a label, but an enrichment not only of the sub-genre, but the whole genre too.' - The Guardian",N/A,N/A,en

Night,['Alfred Alvarez'],1996-02,['Dream'],"A. Alvarez examines night in all its aspects. How do we light it? How do we inhabit it and make it safe? In what ""languages"" do we dream? The search moves from the neon-lit brilliance of Las Vegas to the shadowy underworld patrolled by the police. We visit a sleep laboratory, where scientists try to understand what happens to our bodies and in our brains when sleep claims us. Alvarez shows how ""night horrors"" inspired and terrified Coleridge, and how dreams liberated the minds of Stevenson and the Surrealists. He talks about his own childhood fears and explores the secret world of the unconscious. Through a highly original and accessible account of the thoughts of Freud, Jung, and their modern-day counterparts, as well as the latest scientific theories, Alvarez reveals how deeply dreams and the unconscious color and fashion our waking lives.",N/A,N/A,en
