Technik in Dystopien,"['Viviana Chilese', 'Heinz-Peter Preusser']",2013,['Dystopia'],"In der literarischen und filmischen Produktion der letzten Jahre begegnet man technischen Innovationen haufig mit eindeutiger Ablehnung. Die Lesbarkeit des Gehirns oder die Ersetzbarkeit des Korpers in der immateriellen Internetwelt etwa werden zu Schreckensszenarien einer diktatorischen Macht mit omniprasenter Kontrolle ausgedeutet. Dieser technikkritische Diskurs ignoriert aber oft die tatsachlichen Errungenschaften der Technik. Der Band 'Technik in Dystopien' strebt an, den Hiatus zwischen den getrennten Diskursen von Forschung einerseits und ihrem gesellschaftlichen Bild andererseits zu verringern, indem er eine Plattform bietet, die Wechselwirkung von Dystopien und Technik interdisziplinar zu erortern. Wie kann Wissen oder Nichtwissen kunftige Szenarien bestimmen und problematisieren? Wie wird Technik moralisch bewertet, diskreditiert oder gefeiert? Antworten darauf geben die AutorInnen in den Sektionen Gesellschaftstechnologien, Medien- und Informations- sowie Biotechnologien.",N/A,N/A

The Arrest,['Jonathan Lethem'],2020-11-10,[],"From the award-winning author of The Feral Detective and Motherless Brooklyn comes an utterly original postapocalyptic yarn about two siblings, the man that came between them, and a nuclear-powered super car. The Arrest isn't post-apocalypse. It isn't a dystopia. It isn't a utopia. It's just what happens when much of what we take for granted--cars, guns, computers, and airplanes, for starters--quits working. . . . Before the Arrest, Sandy Duplessis had a reasonably good life as a screenwriter in L.A. An old college friend and writing partner, the charismatic and malicious Peter Todbaum, had become one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. That didn't hurt. Now, post-Arrest, nothing is what it was. Sandy, who calls himself Journeyman, has landed in rural Maine. There he assists the butcher and delivers the food grown by his sister, Maddy, at her organic farm. But then Todbaum shows up in an extraordinary vehicle: a retrofitted tunnel-digger powered by a nuclear reactor. Todbaum has spent the Arrest smashing his way across a fragmented and phantasmagorical United States, trailing enmities all the way. Plopping back into the siblings' life with his usual odious panache, his motives are entirely unclear. Can it be that Todbaum wants to produce one more extravaganza? Whatever he's up to, it may fall to Journeyman to stop him. Written with unrepentant joy and shot through with just the right amount of contemporary dread, The Arrest is speculative fiction at its absolute finest.",N/A,N/A
