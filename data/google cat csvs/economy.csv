Coexisting Contemporary Civilizations,['Guy Ankerl'],2000,['History'],"Some important questions are discussed in this book: Are there any civilisations other than the Western one living in our so-called Global-Age? 'Eastern civilisation'? Is the concept of East anything more than non-West? Or does there exist, in reality, a distinct Chinese, Indian, Arabo-Muslim, and Western civilisation? Is the construction of large civilisation-states such as China and India an unparalleled historical achievement? Do economic ties always eclipse other forms of affiliation such as those formed through kinship or between speech communities? What is the role of the 'Latin' and the Jewish Peoples in our Anglo-American-led Western world? Is English today the global language or merely an international one? Is the Chinese thought pattern closely related to its writing system? Is today's world one of (symmetrical) interdependence? Or rather one of hegemony? If the so-called North-South or East-West dialogue fails in constructing a universally accepted world civilisation, then what is the appropriate arrangement for reaching such a consensus within humankind?",N/A,N/A,en

System Zoo 3 Simulation Models,['Hartmut Bossel'],2007,['Business & Economics'],"About the book: Mathematical modeling and computer simulation make it possible to understand and control the dynamic processes taking place in complex systems. Simulation provides insights into the often surprising diversity of possible behaviors, and allows identifying possibilities for intervention and options for alternative development. About one hundred simulation models from all areas of life are fully documented in the three volumes of the 'System Zoo'. They can be quickly implemented and easily operated using freely available system dynamics software. Volume 3 of the System Zoo contains simulation models of economic and social systems and global development, among them: production, stocks and orders, marketing and consumption, competition, life planning, employment, ecotax, escalation, dependence, aggression, population and community development, debt crisis, globalization, the world models of the Club of Rome (by Forrester and the Meadows group) and examples of nonnumerical knowledge processing applied to impact assessment and decision processes. The System Zoo collection of simulation models is particularly well-suited for teaching, training, and research projects at all levels from high school to university, and for individual study. Volume 1 of the System Zoo contains simulation models of elementary systems, and of systems from the fields of physics and engineering. Volume 2 of the System Zoo presents simulation models related to climate, vegetation, ecosystems and resources. About the author: Hartmut Bossel is Professor Emeritus of environmental systems analysis. He taught for many years at the University of California in Santa Barbara and the University of Kassel, Germany, where he was director of the Center for Environmental Systems Research until his retirement. He holds an engineering degree from the Technical University of Darmstadt, and a Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Berkeley. With a background in engineering, systems science, and mathematical modeling, he has led many research projects and future studies in different countries, developing computer simulation models and decision support systems in the areas of energy supply policy, global dynamics, orientation of behavior, agricultural policy, and forest dynamics and management. He has written numerous books on modeling and simulation of dynamic systems, social change and future paths, and has published widely in the scientific literature in several fields.",N/A,N/A,en

The Politics of Cultural Work,['Mark Banks'],2007-11-09,['Business & Economics'],"What is 'cultural work'? How are we to understand the 'art-commerce relation'? The Politics of Cultural Work answers these questions through a wide-ranging study of labour in the cultural industries. It critically evaluates how various sociological traditions - including critical theory, governmentality and liberal-democratic approaches - have sought to theorize the creative cultural worker, in art, music, media and design-based occupations. It evaluates whether the cultural worker should be seen as a creative, autonomous subject - or as a mere victim of the 'culture industry'",N/A,N/A,en

Though the approach is non-mathematical, simple algebra has been used to give a concrete view of economic concepts and theories and to show the applicability of economic theories in decision making.",4,N/A,en

Firm Innovation in Emerging Markets,['Meghana Ayyagari'],2007,['Business enterprises'],"The authors investigate the determinants of firm innovation in over 19,000 firms across 47 developing economies. They define the innovation process broadly, to include not only core innovation such as the introduction of new products and new technologies, but also other types of activities that promote knowledge transfers and adapt production processes. The authors find that more innovative firms are large exporting firms characterized by private ownership, highly educated managers with mid-level managerial experience, and access to external finance. In contrast, firms that do not innovate much are typically state-owned firms without foreign competitors. The identity of the controlling shareholder seems to be particularly important for core innovation, with those private firms whose controlling shareholder is a financial institution being the least innovative. While the use of external finance is associated with greater innovation by all private firms, it does not make state-owned firms more innovative. Financing from foreign banks is associated with higher levels of innovation compared with financing from domestic banks.",N/A,N/A,en

Colorado; a Guide to the Highest State,['Harry Hansen'],1970,['Travel'],"The Colorado Guide is one of the shining accomplishments of the Federal Writers, who were recruited by the WPA in the days of the great depression to record the dynamic story of their State. So fruitful were their door-to-door inquiries that the public has acclaimed their labors and called for their book ever since. In the last few years it has become evident that the state was outgrowing its guide. The spectacular facts of history remained unaltered, but practically everything else burst its seams. The cities pushed beyond their limits the colleges were jammed with youth; the hard-surfaced roads unlocked remote natural wonder; the rushing rivers created dozens of new lakes; even the snowclad mountains yielded to airlift. A thorough revision was called for--and here it is. Here is the parade of the cities: Denver, the Mile-High Metropolis, building convention halls and hotels in the shadow of the gold-plated Capitol; Colorado Springs, gateway to NORAD, Pike's Peak, and the US Air Force Academy; Boulder, multiplying scientific laboratories of national renown; Pueblo, rolling steel; Aspen, spreading culture in summer and training ski jumpers in winter; even Lakewood, carved out of Denver's side, latest of the big ones. Ever since Zebulon Pike stood awe-struck before the towering Rockies Americans have flocked to Colorado to mine its wealth, cultivate its soil, build its factories, and fish in its trout-filled steams. At one end of its history are the stone houses of the Cliff Dwellers; at the other, the busy airports serving the continent. This Guide takes account of the nostalgic past and the tumultuous present. It tells how to get there, by plane, bus, train and motor car, and what roads to follow to the teeming cities, the peaks, gorges and canyons, the campgrounds and ghost towns. It describes the great changes of the last twenty-five years, during which engineering has built dams and reservoirs for irrigation, electric power and flood control; scientific mining has uncovered minerals of which the goldseekers never dreamed. It tells about the mechanization of farms and the growth of the sugar beet industry; the expansion of feed lots for cattle and the forty-odd rodeos at which the cowhands let off steam. In other words--Colorado.",N/A,N/A,en

Para salir de la crisis global,['Ramón Tamames'],2009-05-25,['Business & Economics'],"En este libro Para salir de la crisis global. Análisis y soluciones, el profesor Ramón Tamames se pronuncia sobre cuestiones fundamentales de lo que ha sido un naufragio financiero y económico de dimensiones mundiales y de perspectivas más que complicadas. Prácticamente en todo el planeta, entre mediados de la década de 1990 y 2007, se produjo una expansión económica fuerte y sostenida. Durante esos tiempos de bonanza y prosperidad, los agentes del sistema bancario y sus aledaños no repararon en el empleo de cualquier clase de medios para conseguir beneficios astronómicos. Con la consecuencia de que esa actuación codiciosa y temeraria puso a todo el complejo sistema financiero al borde del colapso sistémico. Aparentemente, la crisis económica, que hemos dado en llamar global, tuvo su origen en EE. UU., pero ya estaba incubándose en la mayoría de los demás países avanzados y también en los emergentes. Siendo a partir de mediados de 2008 cuando se calibró que no se trataba de un episodio más o menos pasajero, sino que se había entrado en una situación estructuralmente de muy graves consecuencias. Los meses siguientes se sucedieron entre el desánimo, el pánico y los paquetes de medidas que fueron ideándose, a pesar de lo cual la recuperación económica aún parece distante. En el libro se examinan los orígenes de la crisis con las burbujas financiera e inmobiliaria en EE. UU., Unión Europea, España, países emergentes y Latinoamérica. Y se trazan los principales rasgos de solución, con nuevos sistemas de regulación y supervisión, y mayor cooperación internacional.",N/A,N/A,es

"Dynamiques comportementales, technologiques et institutionnelles des alliances en recherche et développement",['Julia Taddei Stradi'],2012-03-29,['Economy'],"Dès son origine, l’économie telle qu’elle a été théorisée, a mis en évidence le rapport d’interdépendance triptyque entre les dynamiques comportementales, technologiques et institutionnelles. De Smith avec sa “main invisible”, à Marx et son analyse des rapports de production, Schumpeter, jusque plus récemment Romer et la théorie de la croissance endogène, on retrouve en chacun cette triade. Alors que de nouveaux modes de production se sont succédés, que diverses formes du capitalisme se sont élaborées, en dépit de ces métamorphoses structurelles et paradigmatiques cette trinité économique demeure, et l’on constate que toutes les branches et dérivations de l’économie se sont étoffées, étiolées ou accrues autour et à partir de cette corrélation étroite entre comportement, technologie et institution. Dès lors, il apparaît comme une évidence que de mettre en lumière ces trois ressorts à l’œuvre afin de cerner la phase que l’on traverse, comprendre comment ils évoluent ensemble pour transformer le système économique. à partir de cela, il sera nécessaire de trouver une voie uniforme et hétérogène face à l’incompatibilité des diverses théories élaborées, mais aussi face à l’équivocité théorique des différents concepts majeurs que sont les comportements, les institutions, et la technologie. Face au constat catastrophiste et au discours récurrent sur la crise économique actuelle, ne doit-on voir venir cette fatale destinée que comme résignés, comme si finalement, l’économie ne se régulait que par elle-même et ainsi ne pouvait que s’autodétruire sans que l’on ait la moindre marge d’action ? Comprendre l’économie, mieux cerner cette période charnière dont nous sommes les spectateurs, voilà tout l’intérêt de cet ouvrage. Julia Taddei Stradi met en lumière l’économie, selon une perspective épistémologique, ses constituants majeurs afin de mieux rendre compte de ses évolutions. Comprendre que l’économie est phénoménologiquement et ontologiquement la résultante de la dynamique à la fois comportementale, technologique et institutionnelle, voilà toute l’originalité et toute la pertinence de cette thèse.",N/A,N/A,fr

El lector encontrará respuesta a cuestiones como éstas: ¿La devaluación interna incentiva la demanda? ¿Es realmente rígido el mercado de trabajo español? ¿Por qué los empleados no participan en la gestión de las empresas? ¿Rebajar la partida de gastos salariales mejora la competitividad? ¿El Estado controla a las entidades a las que inyecta fondos públicos? ¿Alemania es un compañero imparcial interesado en que España mejore? ¿Qué futuro se dibuja para Europa? ¿Qué nos adeudan las eléctricas? ¿Y si el medioambiente fuese una oportunidad?

Políticas Públicas Estruturantes para o Brasil do Século XXI,['Maria Alice Nunes Costa'],2023-10-24,['Fiction'],"Na segunda década do século XXI, o Brasil ainda vive o dilema de como compatibilizar crescimento econômico com desenvolvimento social e distribuição de renda para mínimo existencial de seus cidadãos. Os bens de serviços públicos essenciais aos trabalhadores, como saneamento básico, saúde, educação, moradia, segurança e transporte são inexistentes ou aquém da dignidade humana e, consequentemente, ineficazes para a prosperidade do país. Nessa esteira, este livro Políticas públicas estruturantes para o Brasil do século XXI traz propostas e reflexões sobre a universalização dos serviços públicos essenciais, bem como temas de cultura, ciência, inovação, reindustrialização, setor elétrico e transição energética. Os capítulos problematizam, com bastante rigor e seriedade, o cenário que está posto e os desafios a enfrentarmos, em várias dimensões, com o objetivo de fomentar o debate na sociedade e mobilizar diferentes agentes sociais, lideranças políticas e econômicas à sinergia de esforços em torno de um planejamento estratégico que garanta a efetividade e a eficiência de políticas públicas estruturantes para solucionar ou mitigar os nossos problemas históricos, estruturais e crônicos.",N/A,N/A,pt-BR

La ciencia humilde,['Alfredo Pastor'],2007-11,['Business & Economics'],"No cabe duda de que vivimos en un mundo regido por los fenómenos económicos: el paro, la inflación, la política fiscal, el precio del dinero, los mercados, los tipos de interés, la política monetaria, el papel del Estado, la distribución mundial de la renta o la naturaleza de las leyes del mercado. Esos fenómenos afectan y condicionan nuestras vidas todos los días del año. Sin embargo, no conocemos bien los mecanismos de la economía, que nos parecen cosa de sesudos especialistas. Pero ¿por qué nos asusta la ciencia económica? ¡Si es muy fácil! Se trata de aplicar el sentido común y huir de los tópicos. Muchos de los términos de la economía, en apariencia técnicos, que manejan economistas y políticos, no se dirigen tanto a nuestro entendimiento como a nuestras emociones, para despertar en nosotros sentimientos de aprobación o rechazo: no son razonamientos, sino pura propaganda. Aprendamos a distinguirlos. Desde su particular visión y en un lenguaje gratísimo por su sencillez, Alfredo Pastor consigue con este libro que, casi sin darnos cuenta, dominemos para siempre los principios básicos de una materia que todos construimos sin cesar: esa ciencia (en realidad humilde) que está -o debería estar- al servicio del ciudadano, y no al revés.",N/A,N/A,es

Determinants of Current Account Deficits in Developing Countries,"['Norman Loayza', 'César Calderón']",1999,['Buffer'],"Abstract: July 2000 - In developing countries, increases in current account deficits tend to be associated with a rise in domestic output growth and shocks that increase the terms of trade and cause the real exchange rate to appreciate. Higher savings rates, higher growth rates in industrial economies, and higher international interest rates tend to have the opposite effect. Calderón, Chong, and Loayza examine the empirical links between current account deficits and a broad set of economic variables proposed in the literature. To accomplish this, they complement and extend previous research by using a large, consistent set of macroeconomic data on public and private domestic savings, external savings, and national income variables; focusing on developing economies by drawing on a panel data set for 44 developing countries and annual information for the period 1966-95; adopting a reduced-form approach rather than holding to a particular structural model; distinguishing between within-country and cross-country effects; and employing a class of estimators that controls for the problems of simultaneity and reverse causation. Among their findings: Current account deficits in developing countries are moderately persistent; A rise in domestic output growth generates a larger current account deficit; Increases in savings rates have a positive effect on the current account; Shocks that increase the terms of trade or cause the real exchange rate to appreciate are linked with higher current account deficits; Either higher growth rates in industrial economies or higher international interest rates reduce the current account deficit in developing economies. This paper-a product of the Regional Studies Program, Latin America and the Caribbean Region-is part of an effort in the region to understand the determinants of external sustainability.

Murky Waters,[],2012,['Documentary film'],"On the coast of the Bohai Sea, in the Northeast of China, the activities of heavy industries and off-shore drillings during the last decades have turned this gulf into a very prosperous economic area, in part responsible for the country's extraordinary boom. On the down side, the region has become an infamous spot for pollution, significantly affecting, among others, the fishing sector. The latter had already been in difficulties because of overexploitation of maritime resources. Yet, in response to an ever-increasing domestic demand for seafood numerous new fish farms have settled along the shores. Experts speak about more than 400 breeding farms in the region. Lao Li is one of the kings of the fishing sector. He decided to literally follow the slogan in force since the economic reforms: to become as rich as possible! Present here already for a few years, he produces small fry and breeds different seafish. With about thirty employees working on his farm, helped by his nephew, and a faithful foreman taking care of the workers, he concentrates on management issues and delicate missions. If the breeding of fish can be lucrative, it is also expensive and requires specific skills: sharp water management to insure its cleanliness as well as the proper temperature and salinity. It also asks for an important quantity of small fish to feed the bigger ones. It needs careful surveying every day, or else fish become sick or die one after the other. Food safety for future customers is at stake. It is thus not easy to grow rich in so dirty waters... While thin and large tubes, open-air tanks and covered ponds are crowding the horizon, local natural resources are dangerously diminishing: aquifers dry out, the quality of the sea water deteriorates, the fish resources are shrinking: the system is clearly running towards disaster. Nobody knows until when... Perhaps the plan to build a highway along the coast will put an end to this situation? .",N/A,N/A,en

Dust,[],2012,['Economy'],"Shenzhen, once a small fishing village near Hong Kong, has today joined the ranks of Chinese megacities and is often cited as a prime example of China's extraordinary economic boom. With the economic reforms in the 80's, the smallest neighbour of then British supertown of Hong Kong had indeed been chosen as an experimental development site for the market economy. To enable this incredible urban sprawl, metropolitan planners had to rely on foreign investments but also on the strength of millions of construction workers who, in most cases, had left their rural communities in search of well paid jobs. In this film, we particularly focus on the fate of drilling workers who, lured by very attractive salaries, dig shafts into the rock, with a simple hammer drill, to become the necessary foundations of futuristic skyscrapers. Xu Chunlin is one of those for whom a job offer, 20 times better paid than traditional labour work, seemed to be the opportunity not to be missed. Full of hope and with the vitality of a young man, he and five friends left his native village Shuang Xi, near Lei Yang, during the early 90's. He soon realized that working conditions at the shafts bottom, sometimes up to 80 meters underground, were very difficult. He and his comrades did not know that breathing rock dust could be fatal... Poor ventilation and no effective protection was provided, and despite of breathing difficulties, silence prevailed for a long time. Until the day many workers complaining of fatigue, fever and shortness of breath were faced with the terrible diagnosis: they had contracted pneumoconiosis, a chronic fatal respiratory disease, caused by the inhalation of mineral dust over a long period... Today, residents of the Lei Yang region know all too well that this disease is deadly. While Xu Chunlin's mother, regularly mourns the loss of her other three sons, who all died of this disease, two other women also accompany the last days of their husbands, Xu Chunlin's friends. In the otherwise enchanting and picturesque scenery of the rice fields, they cry, uncapable of stopping the fatal issue. These men's lives... A very heavy price to pay for economic and urban growth, which seems to develop without any limits or constraints. .",N/A,N/A,en

This study includes accidents only if they occurred during Alpine skiing, if they were not caused by avalanches, and if the patients had to spend more than 24 h in the hospital for treatment or observation on behalf of torso trauma or polytrauma. One-hundred sixty-seven patients were finally selected by the following criteria: 71% were male, 29% female. The patient's age ranged from 9 to 72 years with an average of 32.2 years.

Heavy Metal,[],2012,['Economy'],"For more than twenty years, tons and tons of metallic and electronic waste from Japan, USA, Australia but also from Europe and other countries was transported to a Chinese town called Fengjiang, in the south of Shanghai. Heaps of metal of all kinds began to form disturbing reliefs within the townscape. Around 50000 migrant workers, avoiding the living conditions of the western poor regions of China, formed a real army to dismantle these metallic wastes. These green soldiers decompose, cut, split and recycle, with the most rudimentary means, almost 2 million tons of garbage every year. The whole city seems to be given rhythm by this relentless work and the noise seems to become blurred only in the dark night ... Allowing us to live this experience on the inside, the director accompanies Han Zhang and Qiuxia Jing's family in their daily life, which, really, seems to be a real arm wrestling with their life. Their sighs and anxieties change nothing. To remain and assume the minimum material of theirs, they work hard, bear an incredible precariousness and risk their own health because of the simply unacceptable working conditions. During this time, the fragments of metals, which look like strangely ours, continue to accumulate, and send back to us a deeply moving image of our consumer society. .",N/A,N/A,en

Flavour and Affinity,[],2012,['Economy'],"It is 6.00 am, in Canton, in the South of China. The employees of the Jin Cheng restaurant get ready: collective dancing and singing will contribute to make this new day a successful one. The stakes are high: the restaurant has a reputation of excellence due to its 'Chao' specialties: to guarantee the authenticity of 'Chao' flavours, the supplying of fish, shellfish and tofu, among many others items, must come from the original source... where the skills of this ethnic group are still applied in accordance with the ancestral rules and where the quality and freshness of the products is indisputable. Nothing can be properly done if the traditions are not respected. Chua Zhon's, the Maître D, makes sure during his daily inspection that everything is perfect: in the kitchen, in the restaurant, in the storage. Today, he leaves as every year, to meet his various suppliers back home. We will travel with him to the provincial birthplace of the Chao ethnic group, some 400 km away from Canton. Here, we will attempt to lift the secrets of those special, unequalled flavours. Meanwhile, the owner, Mr Luo, is concentrating on the opening of his fifth restaurant. The decoration, the date and time of the opening ... everything must be strictly planned, because each detail is very important for a successful business! The presence of the Spirits, duly consulted with the help of a feng shui master, is required at each step of the birth of the restaurant: applying strict management techniques as well as obeying the Spirits is the ultimate guarantee for success. As we follow the workings of this enterprise, we will understand how for the Chao Diaspora, cooking is an excellent cure against nostalgia. The meals enable those who, like Mr Luo, left their native province to seek fortunes far away from home, to perpetuate their culture, their traditional skills, their ethnic belonging ... all the while enjoying delicious food. .",N/A,N/A,en

A Better Life,[],2022,['Demography'],"Around 10 years ago, Houmen, a small coastal fishing town in Southern China, 230 kilometers away from Guangzhou, has witnessed the arrival of a bunch of farmers and their families. Coming from some different regions, and mostly from a distant village in the Sichuan Province, they were in search of a better life: the conditions of their rural life had become unbearable for them. Here, they had to learn from scratch everything for their new activity: the skills of catching fish, but also the art of swimming or the dealing with seasickness... And they had to accept priority for the local fishermen, active on these shores since generations. Since those early days, they still continue to communicate in their own dialect, and they haven't really mixed with the locals. They don't even eat fish, nor do they worship the gods of the seas in the local temple. But gradually they learn more and more about the traditions and every morning, even before daybreak, dozens of their small ships would return from their daily outing and pull in by the port, attracting many people for the fish market. The women are negotiating with the buyers from Canton, settling the accounts, while their husbands busy themselves preparing the next fishing expedition. Fan Ping, Si Mei and their two children form one of these migrant families. Relentlessly, Fan Ping starts everyday in the middle of the night, whatever the weather conditions, attempting, and succeeding, to sustain his family. Since he came here more than a decade ago, he has bought two ships, and they do have indeed a better life. Yet, he's still not convinced that he wants to stay...The nostalgia for the fields in his home village seems to grow in his mind. This is not at all the case of his wife, who doesn't want to return to farming, and much prefers to build their future in Houmen. Sooner or later, won't they have to give up their dream of a better life and return to their roots? Or it is the children who will decide to their place? .",N/A,N/A,en

Prelude to World War Three,"['James Rosone', 'Miranda Watson']",2016-02-04,[],"By the 2020s, America was no longer a world Superpower. The military had been cut to a barebones level, and while the U.S. was focused internally, the door opened for new powers to emerge on the world stage. In the wake of this power vacuum, China and Russia began to flex their military muscles and expand their dominance in the world. The border of India and Pakistan had long been one of the most precarious ticking time bombs waiting to explode, and when a scheme to agitate the tensions in that region is successful, it opened the door for powerful men to begin consolidating authority and start building an Islamic Caliphate. With Europe also weakened by economic decline, the United States was in serious danger from this new threat. In these hazardous times, America was in need of a leader. Henry Stein, a new kind of leader, built a new political party that is neither Republican nor Democrat to lead the charge to bring the country back from the brink.

A Harsh Transition,[],2018,['Economy'],"The implementation of the capitalist system can bring along a few surprises. A complex, often challenging documentary about globalisation, the financial crisis and its consequences. Following the example of one company, the directors deal with the hopes and dreams of people, and how they had to be changed or adapted as the political and economical framework failed those it swore to serve. In the 1950s, a scientific elite with individuals chosen from all over the country, even abroad, was assembled to develop the nuclear power of China in the country's northwest. After the Economic reform and opening up in the 1980s, the government supported the company by importing the advanced technologies abroad and established the largest factory of TiO2 (titanium dioxide) of China. In 2009, the global financial crisis and the transformation of China's economic system struck the company down and caused the 1200 employees to be struggling on the edge of poverty. Live or die? A battle was waged between different parties: employees, manager, investors, shareholders...Through years of tracking, this documentary shows the true battle of this Chinese company within a hybrid communist-liberal economy. The ups and downs of this struggle is vividly narrated through the interviews from different angles with all the critical people involved. The destiny of an enterprise in a centrally organised economy is determined by government policies; and the fate of every individual involved is influenced by the entity's decisions. Such conflictual situation is a particular phenomenon in China's economic transformation. From viewing this documentary, audience will get a thorough picture of how Chinese enterprises and their people survive in a complex and volatile society in transition. It shows how the ups and downs of an important enterprise affect each individual, and also how actually the so-called economic reforms can impact realities in contemporary China. .",N/A,N/A,en
The Secret of the Roast Pigeon,[],2012,['Documentary film'],"Mr Jiu and Mrs Yi are the owners of a small restaurant in the heart of Canton. Associates for more than 30 years, they operate under a simple rule: she runs the business while he is the king of the kitchen. He invented the restaurants priced speciality: a pigeon roasted with a mixture of particular ingredients, which attracts the majority of their customers, and jealously guards the secret of its preparation. Due to increasing competition, profits have gone down lately; indeed it's only the success of the roasted pigeon that keeps them going. The crisis is met differently by the two associates: Mrs Yi attempts to get the restaurant classified, but Mr. Jiu, close to retirement, is ready to let go. The big question rests: to whom should he reveal his secret? And under what conditions? To his distress, his son has no intention whatsoever in becoming a chef: he is only interested in the Internet, big cars and an easy life. Jiu hopes that he will change his mind as he grows up. But meanwhile, he visits one of his former pupils, now a successful restaurant owner in Peking, to get an idea of what kind of deal he could strike for his secret. Even his wife wants it, suggesting they should open a take-away. As the story reaches its surprising conclusion, Jiu starts to ask himself, if after all, he shouldn't keep the secret to himself.

Three Strings for Two Storytellers,[],2010,['Documentary film'],"The very ancient tradition of a storyteller going from one valley to the next spreading news from the outside world tends to decline. A couple with great experience of this street art, Gai Ying Mu and her husband Gai Ming He, nowadays only perform on demand. But when the antique loudspeaker announces their show, the peasants of the isolated valleys of the northern part of China gather together to listen in awe. They enjoy the pleasure of escaping from their everyday problems through the traditional stories they are being told with the help of a three-string instrument. Unfortunately, to make a living from this art becomes more and more difficult. Mu accuses her husband of being responsible for all the evils afflicting their life and she resents his failure to envisage a different future for their children. But, while He stubbornly goes on trying to teach the art of the three strings to their children, Mu decides to take the bull by the horns: she will have her own business, a road side snack, offering grilled lamb offal to the villagers. Sometimes, He resigns himself to help her set up her stall and he also offers his services as a occasional handyman to other people. Nevertheless, he does not want to give up and goes on looking for places where to perform their show. We return to the same family ten years later: the children, who are now also married, have their own children. Liang, the son, has become a cook, Jing, the daughter, is a beautician. Today they gather for a family reunion. After lunch, the instruments as well as the famous loudspeaker are loaded into the car. The couple is to give a performance in a neighbouring valley. Even if the casting of the little orchestra is bigger - three young apprentices now accompany the duo - the few spectators are much less enthusiastic than 10 years ago. However, the show goes on and our original couple adapts the old stories to current realities. The tradition of ancient storytelling remains alive: Ancestral China stands up against the assaults of modernity. .",N/A,N/A,en

A Family in the Sinkhole,[],2018,['Economy'],"Mother and Son in a small community are confronting each other about the future of their village. Situated in the biggest sinkhole in China's Yunnan Province, the small village of Daguoquan has attracted an increasing number of visitors in recent years which affected every villager's fate. In the view of the local authorities and some residents the future of the village lies in the further development of tourism. Their belief is that more tourists will generate more income for the villagers. Unfortunately, not everybody supports this view, and many conflicts emerge within the community. The film looks at the fate of young Xiuxiang, who, in line with the tourist development plan, and supported by the local authorities, starts to clean and beautify the area. However, he soon has to confront the resistance of his own mother, who is unwilling to remove the rubbish from her room, and, for her own reasons, insists on keeping her pig in the stone cave. This family dispute serves as a metaphor to illustrate the controversies arising within rural China in relation to contemporary economic and social developments. As the director's camera continues to observe the events, we also witness the realities of the relationship between the villagers and the local authorities. Thanks to the pig, for Xiuxiang and his mother, 2016 will stay a very memorable year! .",N/A,N/A,zh-CN
An Ordinary Season,[],2012,['Economy'],"Tong Zhanhai, a local farmer in the village of Xihaigu of Ningxia Province in China's Northwest hopes that his children will one day leave their hometown, to find a better life elsewhere. The area is indeed a very harsh and unforgiving environment condemning its people to be among the poorest in China. So every year, at wheat harvest time, he leaves his home to work elsewhere in order to pay for his children's education. When the kites start to fly, Tong Zhanhai and a small group of other farmers begin their annual migrant trek, crossing the over 500 kilometres from Ningxia to neighbouring Shaanxi. Their goal is the Guanzhong plain, with its rich soils and abundant water supply, helping the people there by hand-harvesting wheat, like in the olden days. The film records the dayly life of this group of seasonal workers and witnesses their constant struggle to find employment in the more and more mechanized farms. They are facing the harsh reality: the wheat harvest which once took the hand-reaper one month to finish, can now be completed by a combined harvesting machine in only one morning. They manage to find farmers who are willing to pay them, but at a much lower rate than usual. So when Tong Zhanhai returns home and brings funds for his daughters to continue their studies, his companions warn him: this was the last year they will go along with him. And indeed, after a year has passed, and kites are again flying, Tong Zhanhai is the only person in the village to leave for the Guanzhong Plain. We are left wondering how he will handle the daily struggle lying ahead of him. .",N/A,N/A,zh-CN

The Yangtze River's Green Sailors,[],2011,['Economy'],"Descending from a long line of fishermen on the river Yangtze, Liu Gujun, as thousands of other farmers and fishermen of the region, had to redefine his professional activity when the construction of the famous Three Gorges Dam began. His father had even to stop fishing because of the growing river pollution and asked his son to start cleaning the river. In the Chinese tradition of respect for the elder, he took the last wishes of his father very seriously, in particular since the floating waste, held by the dam, was growing on a daily basis, polluting the banks of the gigantic town of Chongqing. Ever since, Liu Gujun puts all his energy into this mission and invests every penny of his personal money into the ambitious venture. For lack of sufficient grants from the government, he even contracts heavy loans to build up a small flotilla of cleaning boats. He also employs people to collect every day, with the help of little ladles (!) the tons of garbage accumulating on the surface of the river. The task is so unrewarding that it becomes difficult for him to find laborers who accept these working conditions. By observing the daily lives of some of these green sailors on their small vessels, we shall be privileged to witness their unsafe struggle. Besides the increasing difficulty of their task due to the continuous rising level of the river, we'll stay with them as they perform their daily rituals of eating and sleeping on the very vessel on which they collect the waste during the day. If before the construction of the dam, nobody had anticipated this floating waste problem, today, nobody can continue to ignore the evidence of the ecological disaster ... .",N/A,N/A,en

Empty City,[],2015,['Economy'],"Yumen has been the first Chinese town where searchers found an oil field. At that time, the town was destined to a staggering economic career, which would be an example for small rural Chinese villages. The government invested so much to realize the Chinese dream: a very active economy bringing his inhabitants to be surrounded by richness. But soon resources run out and big oil companies abandon the town, leaving behind them empty buildings and unemployment for all the immigrants who came there looking for a job. Fifty years after, the town is unrecognizable: even unemployed people left the town to go living and working somewhere else. Today Yumen is a ghost city. There are only desolate landscapes end empty buildings left. The only people who live in there are elderly and sick people who can't afford a removal. They are resigned to die in this place, forgotten by their family. When the Chinese miracle is happening, it's not useless remember the errors of the past. The current miracle could already lay the seed of downfall. .",N/A,N/A,en

This book is based solely on my beliefs, opinions, and how Americans have fallen along the wayside. We need to take back America because we have the power. Obama needs to restore our faith and trust in the government again and that is no easy task because politicians have to be willing to say things that have true meaning. This is a much bigger plan that you bargained for and I hope America will be strong again. To do this, we must be a community willing to look out for each other, helping those that are down, and giving a pathway to success.",N/A,N/A,en

The World's Vegetable Garden,[],2017,['Documentary film'],"This episode takes us to the vast farming lands that the waters of the Mekong irrigate throughout the year and more particularly in the South where the plains naturally become nourishing fields. It is a basin covering over 2,5 million square kilometres giving life to an utmost important green industry: the children of this agriculture are of course called rice, but also fruits, vegetables and flowers. The most impressive beneficiaries of the river's lavishness are the orchids and the lotuses. All along the Southern part of the course of the stream, the climate is very warm and favourable to the production of a large diversity of fruits. They are sold on the great market of Bangkok or, in a more traditional way, on the boats of the numerous floating markets. The climate of the Mekong region is ideal for rice growing. Farming methods are different according to the various countries and ethnic groups. We will witness rice picking -Vietnam and Thailand-, producing of organic fruits -Thailand and also horticulture in China and Thailand. The latter is one of the most important exporter of orchids, over 70 % of the world production. China grows all sorts of flowers and most of the big flower markets also work all night. Modernity and mass production are almost everywhere, as can be noticed in the gigantic flower market in Dounan, China, a miracle of a digital auction place. But in Can Tho City, in Vietnam, we will also follow the steps of a fruit seller working on one of the many floating markets where most of the deals have kept a human size. .",N/A,N/A,en

Power In The Clouds,['Gordon Lloyd Jones'],2024-07-30,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Unveiling the Legacy of Ohio's Power Plants: A Historical Journey Through Their Rise, Operation, and Eventual Decommissioning. Power In The Clouds is a profound exploration into the heart of Mason, Kentucky, and Adams/Brown, Ohio's economic history. This book is a tribute to the Dayton Power and Light Company (DPL), a significant economic blessing that powered these counties and beyond. The author meticulously traces the company's history, providing a comprehensive view of its initial power plants in the Dayton area. This book offers a unique perspective, presenting many distinctive views of the plants both inside and out, and elucidating their intricate workings. It pays homage to the J.M. Stuart Station and Killen Station, acknowledging the invaluable contributions of their employees. The author's narration brings to life the vibrant past of these power plants, their dedicated workforce, and the pivotal role they played in the region's development. Power In The Clouds also delves into the decommissioning and demolition of both plants. It narrates the poignant end of these once-thriving powerhouses, their transformation into mere skeletons of their former selves. The author's evocative storytelling captures the melancholy of this loss, akin to bidding farewell to a dear friend. However, the book doesn't end on a somber note. It looks forward, exploring potential future uses of the plant sites. It encourages readers to envision a new chapter for these sites, one that honors their past while embracing the possibilities of the future. Why Power In The Clouds? The title is a poignant metaphor for the plants' demise. They may no longer exist in physical form, but their legacy continues to power the memories and history of the region. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the rise and fall of these power plants and their lasting impact on the region. It is a tribute, a history, and a vision for the future, all wrapped into one compelling narrative.",N/A,N/A,en

"Organic, Against All Odds",[],2022,['Economy'],"Mr Liang, has a passion for cooking. Aged around 60, he is today the owner of two restaurants and an 'organic' farm in the rich Southern Province of Guangdong, in China. One of his restaurants, small in size, is located in Chongua, not far away from the farm. A few years ago, he converted it to an organic holding and it became a modest success. Encouraged by this experience, he bought a huge restaurant, seating 500 clients, right in the heart of the province's capital, the city of Canton. He attempts to convert this one also into an organic restaurant, but in Canton, the competition is fierce. His wife has enthusiastically supported and helped him during each stage of his ambitious venture and his son has obediently followed his steps. No doubt the three of them represent a really solid team for the everyday management of their business. But Mr Liang's ideals, and his absolute quest for a healthier way of life, have not yet made his Canton business a profitable one. Many still doubt the pertinence of the concept and keep resisting it... Nevertheless, he is deeply convinced of the benefits of a balanced cooking with organic products, and he resolutely attempts to convert his employees and his family. Dedicated and persevering, he shares all his time between his restaurant and his organic farm. He orientates every move of those around him towards his organic methods and aspirations, even if they are, most of the time, very different from the usual rhythms and gestures imposed by our consumer society. The truth is that everything around him is more easily attracted to appearances and short tern profit than to the authenticity of natural flavours. Anyway, his somewhat revolutionary quest meets scepticism and doubts, and even resistance of his employees... the never ending recurrence of resignations from his employees at the farm, the disrespect of his instructions as soon as his back is turned are the most virulent signs of the existing disagreement ...we are left wondering if Mr Liang will finally be shattered by these dissensions or will he remain confident in his quest and tenacious enough to make his dream come true? .",N/A,N/A,en

Dollar Democracy,['Peter Mathews'],2014-02-23,['Campaign funds'],"Second Edition. Big Corporations and their super wealthy owners have bought many American politicians through campaign contributions and lobbying. These politicians have voted to benefit their donors, not the American public. Many American political leaders have made decisions that led to: outsourcing good middle class manufacturing and high tech jobs, dismantling our public education system kindergarten through college and university, deteriorating health care that leaves Americans in danger, sick and broke, destruction and endangering of our environment and lives, polluting of our food supplies through deregulation of Big Agribusiness, pesticide use and the proliferation of Genetically Modified (GMO) foods, the crash of Wall Street and the Great Recession, from which the bottom 99% of Americans have not yet recovered, while the super wealthy top 1% are doing just fine. The Corporate dominated policies of these sponsored politicians have resulted in the greatest gap between the American rich and poor since the Great Depression, and a disappearing middle class. Professor Peter Mathews not only critiques this ""Dollar Democracy"" which brings Liberty and Justice for Some, but he also provides solutions that will bring Liberty and Justice for All, and will help the bottom 99% of Americans Reclaim the American Dream and make it a Reality once again! These solutions include Clean Money Elections and amending the U.S. Constitution to remove Corporate Personhood and to declare that money is not political speech according to the First Amendment.
