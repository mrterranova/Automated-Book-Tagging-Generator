Electrical Systems Design,['M. K. Giridharan'],2015-11-30,['Electric power systems'],"Provides a comprehensive treatment of electrical system design. The text covers on one hand the guiding principles of electrical system design, lighting design, designing for household electricity installation, industrial electrical system installation, exterior lighting, cable sizing, earthing and so on; on the other hand discusses the challenges that an electrical system designer faces to improve power quality, power factor, and energy efficiency.",N/A,N/A,en
Time-domain Reflectometry (TDR) in Geotechnics,"['CH. Benson', 'PJ. Bosscher']",1999,['Automatic test equipment'],"Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is an electromagnetic geophysical technique used in the geosciences to measure water content of unfrozen and frozen soils and concentrations of inorganic solutes. In geotechnical and geological engineering, TDR is used for the same purposes, and also to measure frost depths, water levels, and displacements in soil and rock. Nevertheless, geo-engineers use TDR far less frequently than geo-scientists, primarily because they are unfamiliar with the technology. One purpose of this paper is to explain in practical terms how TDR is used in geo-engineering in each of the aforementioned applications. These descriptions reference the important publications in the literature. Another purpose is to share some of the authors' practical experience using TDR in the field.",N/A,N/A,en
Heat Transfer Testing of Thermal-Magnetic Circuit Breakers,"['WE. DeWitt', 'RW. Adams']",1999,['Circuit breaker'],"The forensic engineering investigation of a fire will include the post-fire examination of electrical panelboards and circuit breakers if such equipment is available on the premises and survives the fire. Post-fire circuit breakers may be found in the on, off, tripped, or unknown position. It is sometimes assumed by investigators that a tripped circuit breaker is the result of an overcurrent condition either before or during the fire. Sometimes the tripped (or untripped) circuit breaker is used to prove or disprove theories about the cause of the fire. Since thermal-magnetic circuit breakers employ thermal sensors, it should be possible for the heat from a fire to be transferred by convection, conduction, and radiation into a circuit breaker and cause it to trip in the absence of an overcurrent condition. It should also be possible for the heat from a fire to shift the circuit breaker time-current characteristic curve and cause the circuit breaker to trip at reduced currents. The question then becomes, at what ambient temperature will the circuit breaker be expected to trip? Also, can the heat from a nearby fire be conducted by the metallic circuit conductors into a circuit breaker and cause, or assist it to trip? If so, what fire conditions are required to cause the circuit breaker to trip? This paper reviews the operating principle of thermal-magnetic circuit breakers, describes a series of heat transfer tests conducted on nine circuit breakers of various ratings and from various manufacturers, presents the results of the tests in graphical form, and discusses the potential impact of conduction and convection heat transfer on circuit breaker performance during fires.",N/A,N/A,en
