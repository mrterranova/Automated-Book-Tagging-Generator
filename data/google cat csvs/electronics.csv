An Introduction to Electromagnetic Wave Propagation and Antennas,['Shane Cloude'],1995,['Science'],"This highly illustrated and accessible text will be an ideal introduction to the application of electromagnetics (EM) following an initial course in basic EM theory. The book covers the well established structure of elementary EM courses, beginning with Maxwell’s equations in integral form and developing the wave equation to show the essential properties of waves. In addition to providing a grounding in this traditional curriculum, the principal concern throughout is to make difficult concepts of electromagnetism more accessible. The adoption of time domain methods for this purpose is the book’s most important breakthrough, allowing the fundamentals of applied electromagnetics to be introduced with a clarity and simplicity not available through the conventional route. Another new aspect of this book is the integration of computational modelling methods with the standard theory of electromagnetic waves. The author presents a set of example programs written in the MATLAB language to support the ideas outlined in the text. The book is organized in a logical progression of ideas, starting with the general idea of wave motion and showing how the equations of electricity and magnetism lead to the existence of electromagnetic waves through the Maxwell’s equations. These ideas are then applied to simple accelerating charge models used in the engineering design of wire antennas. The concepts of resonance and antenna impedance are then treated from a time domain point of view. To reinforce the concepts of wave propagation, a chapter on computer modelling shows the rigorous procedures required to generate accurate numerical models of wave dynamics. The author extends these ideas to consider the properties of aperture antennas, showing how their important properties can be incorporated with the basic themes introduced earlier in the book. Finally, the important topic of wave scattering is introduced, once again fromthe point of view of time domain concepts.",N/A,N/A,en

Automotive Lighting and Human Vision,"['Burkard Wördenweber', 'Jörg Wallaschek', 'Peter Boyce', 'Donald D. Hoffman']",2007-03-13,['Technology & Engineering'],"It is possible to buy excellent books on human vision as well as about automotive lighting. Unfortunately, these books have little or no common content. But in fact these fields do overlap. Providing optimal conditions for human vision is what automotive lighting is all about. Our motivation for writing this book arises from interdisciplinary st- ies of human vision and lighting. Initially we intended the book to provide background information on human vision to engineers working in auto- tive lighting. At the same time we planned to introduce basic concepts of automotive lighting to experts in human vision. However because of the intricate connections between human vision and automotive lighting, it turns out that the book provides new insights to anyone interested in either or both subjects. The subject matter is complex and spans a number of disciplines from psychology to mechatronics. Hence there are very few individuals who are experts in all fields. Looking at the nature of human vision, it is surprising to find out how much every one of us takes it for granted. Rarely are we aware of how we use vision predominantly to verify our internal model of our surroundings. Many accidents, particularly at night, stem from the fact that our internal model misrepresented a significant part of our surrou- ings. Taking knowledge on human vision into account in the design of - ture automotive lighting systems reduces the risk of accidents at night.",5,N/A,en

Also included are topics that bear on the precision and absolute accuracy of standards, such as noise, resonance line shape, the relativistic Doppler effect as well as more general relativistic notions of time relevant to synchronization of remote clocks, and time reversal symmetry. This edition retains the essentially didactic approach to the treatment of the development of atomic clocks in the first edition, but brings up to date the extraordinary developments in recent years, culminating in clocks based on quantum resonance at optical frequency in individual ions confined in miniature electromagnetic traps.

Situated in the gap between electronics and optics, the terahertz frequency range of the electro-magnetic spectrum has long been neglected by scientists and engineers due to a lack of efficient and affordable terahertz sources and detectors. The advent of femtosecond lasers in the 1980s and photoconductive switches in 1984 have made the terahertz gap accessible, while at the same time advances in electronics and optics have made it narrower. Research activities in terahertz frequencies have intensified dramatically since that time, funding has increased by a factor of 100 in the last decade.

VLSI Physical Design: From Graph Partitioning to Timing Closure,"['Andrew B. Kahng', 'Jens Lienig', 'Igor L. Markov', 'Jin Hu']",2011-01-27,['Technology & Engineering'],"Design and optimization of integrated circuits are essential to the creation of new semiconductor chips, and physical optimizations are becoming more prominent as a result of semiconductor scaling. Modern chip design has become so complex that it is largely performed by specialized software, which is frequently updated to address advances in semiconductor technologies and increased problem complexities. A user of such software needs a high-level understanding of the underlying mathematical models and algorithms. On the other hand, a developer of such software must have a keen understanding of computer science aspects, including algorithmic performance bottlenecks and how various algorithms operate and interact. ""VLSI Physical Design: From Graph Partitioning to Timing Closure"" introduces and compares algorithms that are used during the physical design phase of integrated-circuit design, wherein a geometric chip layout is produced starting from an abstract circuit design.

Fundamentals of Semiconductor Processing Technology,"['Badih El-Kareh', 'Lou N.

The development of new processing tools and technologies is aimed at optimizing one or more of these requirements. This goal can, however, only be achieved by a concerted effort between scientists, engineers, technicians, and operators in research, development, and manufac turing. It is therefore important that experts in specific disciplines, such as device and circuit design, understand the principle, capabil ities, and limitations of tools and processing technologies. It is also important that those working on specific unit processes, such as lithography or hot processes, be familiar with other unit processes used to manufacture the product. Several excellent books have been published on the subject of process technologies. These texts, however, cover subjects in too much detail, or do not cover topics important to modem tech nologies. This book is written with the need for a ""bridge"" between different disciplines in mind. It is intended to present to engineers and scientists those parts of modem processing technologies that are of greatest importance to the design and manufacture of semi conductor circuits. The material is presented with sufficient detail to understand and analyze interactions between processing and other semiconductor disciplines, such as design of devices and cir cuits, their electrical parameters, reliability, and yield.",N/A,N/A,en

Static Timing Analysis for Nanometer Designs,"['J. Bhasker', 'Rakesh Chadha']",2009-04-03,['Technology & Engineering'],"iming, timing, timing! That is the main concern of a digital designer charged with designing a semiconductor chip. What is it, how is it T described, and how does one verify it? The design team of a large digital design may spend months architecting and iterating the design to achieve the required timing target. Besides functional verification, the t- ing closure is the major milestone which dictates when a chip can be - leased to the semiconductor foundry for fabrication. This book addresses the timing verification using static timing analysis for nanometer designs. The book has originated from many years of our working in the area of timing verification for complex nanometer designs. We have come across many design engineers trying to learn the background and various aspects of static timing analysis. Unfortunately, there is no book currently ava- able that can be used by a working engineer to get acquainted with the - tails of static timing analysis. The chip designers lack a central reference for information on timing, that covers the basics to the advanced timing veri- cation procedures and techniques.",5,N/A,en

Basic Semiconductor Physics,['Chihiro Hamaguchi'],2018-09-04,['Technology & Engineering'],"The new edition of this textbook presents a detailed description of basic semiconductor physics. The text covers a wide range of important phenomena in semiconductors, from the simple to the advanced. Four different methods of energy band calculations in the full band region are explained: local empirical pseudopotential, non-local pseudopotential, KP perturbation and tight-binding methods. The effective mass approximation and electron motion in a periodic potential, Boltzmann transport equation and deformation potentials used for analysis of transport properties are discussed. Further, the book examines experiments and theoretical analyses of cyclotron resonance in detail. Optical and transport properties, magneto-transport, two-dimensional electron gas transport (HEMT and MOSFET) and quantum transport are reviewed, while optical transition, electron-phonon interaction and electron mobility are also addressed. Energy and electronic structure of a quantum dot (artificial atom) are explained with the help of Slater determinants. The physics of semiconductor lasers is also described, including Einstein coefficients, stimulated emission, spontaneous emission, laser gain, double heterostructures, blue lasers, optical confinement, laser modes, and strained quantum well lasers, offering insights into the physics of various kinds of semiconductor lasers. In this third edition, energy band calculations in full band zone with spin-orbit interaction are presented, showing all the matrix elements and equipping the reader to prepare computer programs of energy band calculations. The Luttinger Hamiltonian is discussed and used to analyze the valence band structure. Numerical calculations of scattering rate, relaxation time, and mobility are presented for typical semiconductors, which are very helpful for understanding of transport. Energy band structures and effective masses of nitrides such as GaN, InN, AlN and their ternary alloys are discussed because they are very important materials for the blue light emission, and high power devices with and high frequency. Learning and teaching with this textbook is supported by problems and solutions in the end of the chapters.

Sapphire,"['Elena R. Dobrovinskaya', 'Leonid A. Lytvynov', 'Valerian Pishchik']",2009-04-21,['Technology & Engineering'],"By the second half of the twentieth century, a new branch of materials science had come into being — crystalline materials research. Its appearance is linked to the emergence of advanced technologies primarily based on single crystals (bulk crystals and films). At the turn of the last century, the impending onset of the “ceramic era” was forecasted. It was believed that ceramics would play a role comparable to that of the Stone or Bronze Ages in the history of civilization. Naturally, such an assumption was hypothetical, but it showed that ceramic materials had evoked keen interest among researchers. Although sapphire traditionally has been considered a gem, it has developed into a material typical of the “ceramic era.” Widening the field of sapphire application necessitated essential improvement of its homogeneity and working characteristics and extension of the range of sapphire products, especially those with stipulated properties including a preset structural defect distribution. In the early 1980s, successful attainment of crystals with predetermined char- teristics was attributed to proper choice of the growth method. At present, in view of the fact that the requirements for crystalline products have become more str- gent, such an approach tends to be insufficient. It is clear that one must take into account the physical–chemical processes that take place during the formation of the real crystal structure, i.e., the growth mechanisms and the nature and causes of crystal imperfections.",N/A,N/A,en
