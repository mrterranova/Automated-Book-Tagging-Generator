Lewis R. Heim,['Robert V Jacobs'],2019-08-20,['History'],"Lewis R. Heim was an American machinists, engineer and manufacturer who invented the Centerless Cylindrical Grinder and the Rod End Bearing known as the ""Heim Joint"" and was one of the pioneers of modern antifriction and spherical bearings. Lewis Heim had an inherent ability to visualize complex mechanisms and mechanical processes that resulted in the creation of novel machines, manufacturing methods, tools, and mechanical bearings. He was granted his first patent in 1896 at the age of 22 and his last patent in 1968, four years after his death at age 89. His inventions ranged from machines to manufacture hats and automate the ironing of fold collars, to precision grinders and swaging devices for bearing components plus plain and antifriction bearings used in submarines, tanks, aircraft, trucks, automobiles, and industrial machinery. With every invention Heim sought to improve product designs, increase production rates, and reduce costs to compete in highly competitive markets. Heim became internationally known as an industrialist and designer of machinery and at the time of his retirement, he was president of the Heim Company of Fairfield, Connecticut. During his long career, which spanned more than seven decades, he was granted 92 patents for his inventions, many of which are still in use today. As the inventor of the centerless cylindrical grinder, which was critical to the growth and success of the automobile and aircraft industries, Heim saw his invention revolutionize machine shop practices around the world through the high-speed production of cylindrical metal components used in the internal combustion engine, mechanical bearings, and machines. His invention continues in wide use over 100 years after its conception. Mr. Heim was the original inventor of the Spherical Rod End Bearing that became known as the ""Heim Joint"" and ""Heim Rod End"". With its ability to handle misalignment and relatively heavy loads in linkages transmitting motion or power, it was developed at the request of US Army Air Force and installed in most US and Allied aircraft by the end of World War II. The Rod End, and its cousin, the Spherical Plain Bearing, continues to be widely used in aircraft and machines requiring their unique abilities.",N/A,N/A

"Twenty Twenty Vision: Panic in the Pandemic. Navigating Composing, Writing, Arranging, Producing and Performing During the Pandemic",['Bruce Monical'],2021,['Arranger'],"Twenty Twenty Vision: Panic in the Pandemic is a collection of compositions, songs, arrangements, and productions that were written, composed, and produced during the two-year time frame enveloping the 2020 pandemic. These musical works are a demonstration of composition, songwriting, arranging, orchestration and production techniques that I have learned during my attendance in the Master of Music in Commercial Music program at California State University, Los Angeles, my previous attendance in the Bachelor of Music in Music Composition: Commercial and Media Writing program at California State University, Northridge, my previous attendance in the Associate of Music, and Commercial Music programs at Los Angeles Valley College, and from my work as a professional musician, producer and recording engineer. I seek to illustrate the meaning and conception behind the lyrics and music and to discuss the production techniques used.",N/A,N/A

The Corrected and Updated Anarchist Cookbook,['Yogi Shan'],2015-04-25,['Anarchism'],"Just like the title says, this is a reworking of the famous, but error-ridden book, ""The Anarchist Cookbook"" (1971).Read *all* the amazon.com reader reviews, not just the extremely negative ones. I still have 30-40% of reviewers who rate the book as 5 star or 4 star. I believe the negative reviewers are just blatant attempts to suppress this ""dangerous"" book from potential buyers for political reasons. This book is up to Version 2.30! Latest updated edition with meth synthesis with pseudoephedrine purified from additive, a complete re-write of the chloral hydrate synthesis, new info on govt. surveillance, psychedelic mushrooms & alcohol, amongst other changes/corrections/additions.Now with extensive information on Solvents, and how to make chloroform out of acetone and bleach.Also How to Make:tetryl HE (high explosive)picric acid HEammonium nitrate - Nitromethane HEephedrine to methamphetamine and other drug syntheses.Electronic Bugging & Telephone Wire-tapping /Police and Government surveillance and counter-surveillance.Detailed descriptions of Guns, Knives, and Other Personal concealable weapons.",N/A,N/A
