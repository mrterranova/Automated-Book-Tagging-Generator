The Entrepreneurial Society,['David B. Audretsch'],2007-07-02,['Business & Economics'],"In the depiction of the post-World War II economy, two factors mattered for economic growth: capital and labor. Economists were thus focused on macroeconomic policy, in order to induce investment in capital, while social institutions like education were oriented towards producing a labor force equipped to work in an economy consisting of large-scale factories. However, in the leading developed economies, globalization and technology have triggered a shift away from capital, which can be moved to lower-cost locations through downsizing and outsourcing of employment, and towards knowledge. Audretsch argues in this book that the entrepreneurial economy is the strategic response to this shift. In this economy, a new growth policy has emerged, focusing on promoting knowledge capital and entrepreneurship capital with programs like incubators, science parks, and start-up programs. In addition, knowledge-based geographic clusters have arisen, like Silicon Valley, Cambridge, and Bangalore. This book will provide a lens for understanding and interpreting the emergence of entrepreneurship policy. Audretsch will make connections between entrepreneurship and economic growth at the levels of individual firms and entire regions. He concludes that entrepreneurship contributes to economic growth by serving as a conduit for knowledge spillovers, injecting competition into the market for new ideas, and increasing the amount of diversity. This book should appeal to researchers and students in developmental economics.",N/A,N/A,en

The House of Saud in Commerce,['Sharaf Sabri'],2001,['Business & Economics'],"In the evolutionary process of Saudi Arabia, the period beginning with the seventies marked by the 'oil revolution' can be described as the turning point. With this began a phase of consolidation and institutionalisation of the royal government. One important development having bearing on its nation building project has been the participation of the Royal Family members in economic activities of the country. Since the seventies, over the last three decades, it is clearly visible that the engagement of the Saudi Royal Family in economy and business has grown not only in volume but in form also. This study has attemped to look at the sprawling business activities of the Royal Family members, not merely as a profile but relate it to the evolutionary context. The first major study that examines the gradual process of emerging entrepreneurship in the Saudi Royal Family. It highlights the role of the royal entrepreneurs in the development of the Saudi private sector. The study shows that their investments have created a positive climate for the growth of entrepreneurship, especially productive entrepreneurship, on the Saudi business scene. An indispensable store-house of detailed account of the investments made by more that 600 royal members, including princesses in 1050 Saudi companies. Supported with 28 pages of index and 14 tables, this data-packed book is a bonanza for businessmen, diplomats, laymen, and all those interested in Saudi Arabia and its Royal Family. A must-have book that contains biographical and kinship details of the Aal Saud. The book is one of its kind and is fully based on firsthand local sources.

But it drives home Yuri Slezkine’s provocative thesis: Jews have adapted to the modern world so well that they have become models of what it means to be modern. While focusing on the drama of the Russian Jews, including émigrés and their offspring, The Jewish Century is also an incredibly original account of the many faces of modernity—nationalism, socialism, capitalism, and liberalism. Rich in its insight, sweeping in its chronology, and fearless in its analysis, this is a landmark contribution to Jewish, Russian, European, and American history.",N/A,N/A,en

It is the antidote to bland writing and bland thinking."" - Tom Peters ""Funky Business - the groovy bible of modern business philosophy"" - Red magazine In the best-selling Funky Business Kjell Nordstrom and Jonas Ridderstrale launch a manifesto for difference in business. Move it. In 1995, 1000 new soft drinks were launched on the Japanese market. A year later, 1% of them were still for sale. Move it fast. If you are driving a 1990 model car, approximately six years were spent developing it. Today, most companies do that job in two years. Move it faster. At Hewlett Packard, the majority revenues come from products that did not exist a year age. Move it now. In Tokyo, you can order a customized Toyota on Monday and be driving it on Friday. More products, more markets, more people, more competition. In a world of abundance and excess, competition is total and competition is personal. Difference rules. If you think about it, most of what your business does could be bought from someone else using the Yellow Pages or an Internet search engine. How are you going to be attractive? By being more efficient? By doing it cheaper? Come on!

In the course of the last 30 years China has become a major player in the global economy and today is on a trajectory towards even greater prominence. In recent years, the Chinese economy seems to have reached an imp- tant threshold line of economic development and global integration. In the first quarter century of reform and global opening, Chinese enterprises have been largely confined to a ‘passive’ role in the global division of - bor. Foreign enterprises as the proprietors of greatly superior business models, production technologies, management models as well as very competitively established brands have been integrating Chinese players in their value chains and global operations. Lacking the necessary production technologies, products as well as marketing knowledge to successfully - dress OECD-consumers, Chinese enterprises have been hardly able to - ter the global markets without such guidance. Now, this constellation is changing.",5,N/A,en
"Start Small, Stay Small",['Rob Walling'],2010,['Business & Economics'],"Start Small, Stay Small is a step-by-step guide to launching a self-funded startup. If you're a desktop, mobile or web developer, this book is your blueprint to getting your startup off the ground with no outside investment.This book intentionally avoids topics restricted to venture-backed startups such as: honing your investment pitch, securing funding, and figuring out how to use the piles of cash investors keep placing in your lap.This book assumes: You don't have $6M of investor funds sitting in your bank account You're not going to relocate to the handful of startup hubs in the world You're not going to work 70 hour weeks for low pay with the hope of someday making millions from stock options There's nothing wrong with pursuing venture funding and attempting to grow fast like Amazon, Google, Twitter, and Facebook. It just so happened that most people are not in a place to do this.Start Small, Stay Small also focuses on the single most important element of a startup that most developers avoid: marketing. There are many great resources for learning how to write code, organize source control, or connect to a database. This book does not cover the technical aspects developers already know or can learn elsewhere. It focuses on finding your idea, testing it before you build, and getting it into the hands of your customers.",5,N/A,en
Entrepreneurs,"['Bill Bolton', 'John Thompson']",2000,['Business & Economics'],"A study of entrepreneurs, not just in small businesses, but within all sectors of the market. Using case studies to show the different types, the authors provide theoretical chapters on issues within entrepreneurship, the process, where it goes wrong, and how it can be encouraged and sustained. We all know an entrepreneur when we see one. This ground-breaking book reviews more than a hundred entrepreneurs from all walks of life and backgrounds, and sets their stories within a rigorous analytical framework, in order to give a critical insight into: * What entrepreneurs do and achieve * How they go about it * How they could be better supported The key point though is whether there are more people ""out there"" with the potential to be successful entrepreneurs, and, if so, how they might be identified and fostered. This book opens up this subject using for the first time the themes of talent, temperament and technique, which, in the correct mix, produce outstanding entrepreneurs. Using the ideas presented, it should be possible to tap more effectively the well of entrepreneurial talent that the authors identify. The release of this entrepreneurial talent could transform the numerous programmes for promoting business start-up and growth. It is the missing ingredient in many of these initiatives.",N/A,N/A,en

Zero to One,['Peter A. Thiel'],2018,['Diffusion of innovations'],"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets. The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself. Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.",N/A,N/A,en

Entrepreneurship Policy: Theory and Practice,"['Anders Lundstrom', 'Lois A. Stevenson']",2005-03-30,['Business & Economics'],"Entrepreneurship Policy: Theory and Practice is the first book to fully analyze the construction of entrepreneurship policy, a rapidly-evolving area of policy about which little is known. From a study and assessment of the practices of governments in thirteen countries in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, this book fully describes the policy area and shares new tools and methods for better understanding and explaining the how and why of an entrepreneurship policy approach. The work features a number of new methods which can be used to analyze and assess policy gaps and opportunities for future actions in the area and for understanding the most appropriate mix of policy options. Methods of note include the entrepreneurship policy comprehensiveness index and the context method. It presents a conceptual model describing the many factors which affect, in a dynamic way, the level of entrepreneurship in a country or region. It also describes a typology of entrepreneurship policy which will be useful to others in categorizing their policy approaches. Unlike other research in the field of entrepreneurship where implications from research findings are used to suggest what policy actions should be taken to increase the level of entrepreneurship in an economy, this study is based on what entrepreneurship policy actions are being taken. This is a unique book in the field in that it points the way forward both for policymakers and for the research community in terms of thinking about entrepreneurship policy and the complex issues surrounding its development.",N/A,N/A,en

Chaos Monkeys,['Antonio García Martínez'],2017-02-28,['Biography & Autobiography'],"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER An adrenaline-fuelled exposé of life inside the tech bubble, Chaos Monkeys lays bare the secrets, power plays and lifestyle excesses of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists and money cowboys who are revolutionising our world. Written by startup CEO and industry provocateur Antonio García Martínez, this is Liar's Poker meets The Social Network. Computer engineers use 'chaos monkey' software to wreak havoc and test system robustness. Similarly, tech entrepreneurs like Antonio García Martínez are society's chaos monkeys - their innovations disrupt every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and holidays (Airbnb) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder) - all in search of the perfect business miracle. Describing himself as 'high-strung, fast-talking, and wired on a combination of caffeine, fear, and greed at all times', García Martínez left Wall Street to make his fortune in Silicon Valley, becoming CEO of his own startup, before bailing and being poached by Facebook's nascent advertising team. Here he turned users' data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark 'Zuck' Zuckerberg. Forced out of Facebook in the wake of a bitter internal product war, García Martínez took his unique brand of entrepreneurial hyperactivity to rivals Twitter. Along the way, he got into a lot of trouble with a lot of people, brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg's desk), lived on a yacht, raced sport cars on the highway, and enthusiastically pursued the lifestyle of an overpaid Silicon Valley mercenary. In Chaos Monkeys he tells you HOW - and HOW NOT - to make a fortune through startups and digital marketing. Highly entertaining and always offering genuine insight, García Martínez unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing. From startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetisation and digital 'privacy', he shares both his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a subversive and very funny tour of the fascinatingly insular and unbelievably wealthy tech industry.",N/A,N/A,en

The Voltage Effect,['John A. List'],2022,['Entrepreneurship'],"""A leading economist answers one of today's trickiest questions: Why do some great ideas make it big while others fail to take off? ""Scale"" has become a favored buzzword in the startup world. But scale isn't just about accumulating more users or capturing more market share. It's about whether an idea that takes hold in a small group can do the same in a much larger one-whether you're growing a small business, rolling out a diversity and inclusion program, or delivering billions of doses of a vaccine. Translating an idea into widespread impact, says University of Chicago economist John A. List, depends on one thing only: whether it can achieve ""high voltage""-the ability to be replicated at scale. In The Voltage Effect, List explains that scalable ideas share a common set of attributes, while any number of attributes can doom an unscalable idea. Drawing on his original research, as well as fascinating examples from the realms of business, policymaking, education, and public health, he identifies five measurable vital signs that a scalable idea must possess, and offers proven strategies for avoiding voltage drops and engineering voltage gains. You'll learn: How celebrity chef Jamie Oliver expanded his restaurant empire by focusing on scalable ""ingredients"" (until it collapsed because talent doesn't scale) Why the failure to detect false positives early on caused the Reagan-era drug-prevention program to backfire at scale How governments could deliver more services to more citizens if they focused on the last dollar spent How one education center leveraged positive spillovers to narrow the achievement gap across the entire community Why the right set of incentives, applied at scale, can boost voter turnout, increase clean energy use, encourage patients to consistently take their prescribed medication, and more. By understanding the science of scaling, we can drive change in our schools, workplaces, communities, and society at large. Because a better world can only be built at scale""--",N/A,N/A,en
The Illusions of Entrepreneurship,"['Scott Andrew Shane', 'Scott Shane']",2008,['Business & Economics'],"There are far more entrepreneurs than most people realize. But the failure rate of new businesses is disappointingly high, and the economic impact of most of them disappointingly low, suggesting that enthusiastic would-be entrepreneurs and their investors all too often operate under a false set of assumptions. This book shows that the reality of entrepreneurship is decidedly different from the myths that have come to surround it. Scott Shane, a leading expert in entrepreneurial activity in the United States and other countries, draws on the data from extensive research to provide accurate, useful information about who becomes an entrepreneur and why, how businesses are started, which factors lead to success, and which predict a likely failure. The Illusions of Entrepreneurship is an essential resource for everyone who has dreamed of starting a new business, for investors in start-ups, for policy makers attempting to facilitate the formation and survival of new businesses, and for researchers interested in the economic impact of entrepreneurial activity.

The Internet had a world-changing impact on businesses and the global community over the twenty years from 1994 to 2014. In the next ten years, change will happen even faster.

In The Industries of the Future, Ross distils his observations on the forces that are changing the world.

Mark Carney 'The real story of what it takes from a man who could turn dreams into realities.' Ray Dalio 'Candid, funny and real, Steve offers wisdom and the gift of much-needed common sense chapter by chapter and experience by experience. A great read!' John Kerry From Blackstone chairman, CEO and co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman, a long-awaited book that uses impactful episodes from Schwarzman's life to show readers how to build, transform and lead thriving organisations. Whether you are a student, entrepreneur, philanthropist, executive or simply someone looking for ways to maximise your potential, the same lessons apply. People know who Stephen Schwarzman is - at least they think they do. He's the man who took $400,000 and co-founded Blackstone, the investment firm that manages over $500 billion (as of January 2019). He's the CEO whose views are sought by heads of state. But behind these achievements is a man who has spent his life learning and reflecting on what it takes to achieve excellence, make an impact, and live a life of consequence. Folding handkerchiefs in his father's linen shop, Schwarzman dreamed of a larger life, filled with purpose and adventure. After starting his career in finance with a short stint at a financial firm called DLJ, Schwarzman began working at Lehman Brothers where he ascended to run the mergers and acquisitions practice. He eventually partnered with his mentor and friend Pete Peterson to found Blackstone, vowing to create a new and different kind of financial institution. Building Blackstone into the leading global financial institution it is today didn't come easy. Schwarzman's simple mantra 'don't lose money' has helped Blackstone become a leading private equity and real estate investor, and manager of alternative assets for institutional investors globally. From deal-making to investing, leadership to entrepreneurship, philanthropy to diplomacy, Schwarzman has lessons for how to think about ambition and scale, risk and opportunities, and how to achieve success through the relentless pursuit of excellence. Schwarzman not only offers readers a thoughtful reflection on all his own experiences, but in doing so provides a practical blueprint for success.",N/A,N/A,en

The Voltage Effect,['John A. List'],2022-02-03,['Business & Economics'],"The definitive guide to the science of scalability- how to make good ideas great, and great ideas scale. Why do some ideas make it big while others fail to take off? According to award-winning behavioural economist John List, the answer comes down to a single question- Can the idea scale? Countless enterprises fall apart the moment they scale; their positive results fizzle, they lose valuable time and money, and the great electric charge of potential that drove them early on disappears. In short, they suffer a voltage drop. Yet success and failure are not about luck - in fact, there is a rhyme and reason as to why some ideas fail and why some make it big. Certain ideas are predictably scalable, while others are predictably destined for disaster. In The Voltage Effect, University of Chicago economist John A. List explains how to identify the ideas that will be successful when scaled, and how to avoid those that won't. Drawing on his own original research, as well as fascinating examples from the realms of business, government, education, and public health, he details the five signature elements that cause voltage drops, and unpacks the four proven techniques for increasing positive results - or voltage gains - and scaling great ideas to their fullest potential. By understanding the science of scaling, we can drive change in our schools, workplaces, communities, and society at large. Because a better world can only be built at scale.",N/A,N/A,en

The Art of Money Getting,['Phineas Taylor Barnum'],2018,['Entrepreneurship'],"In the United States, where we have more land than people, it is not at all difficult for persons in good health to make money. In this comparatively new field there are so many avenues of success open, so many vocations which are not crowded, that any person of either sex who is willing, at least for the time being, to engage in any respectable occupation that offers, may find lucrative employment. Those who really desire to attain an independence, have only to set their minds upon it, and adopt the proper means, as they do in regard to any other object which they wish to accomplish, and the thing is easily done. But however easy it may be found to make money, I have no doubt many of my hearers will agree it is the most difficult thing in the world to keep it. The road to wealth is, as Dr. Franklin truly says, ""as plain as the road to the mill."" It consists simply in expending less than we earn; that seems to be a very simple problem. Mr. Micawber, one of those happy creations of the genial Dickens, puts the case in a strong light when he says that to have annual income of twenty pounds per annum, and spend twenty pounds and sixpence, is to be the most miserable of men; whereas, to have an income of only twenty pounds, and spend but nineteen pounds and sixpence is to be the happiest of mortals. Many of my readers may say, ""we understand this: this is economy, and we know economy is wealth; we know we can't eat our cake and keep it also."" Yet I beg to say that perhaps more cases of failure arise from mistakes on this point than almost any other. The fact is, many people think they understand economy when they really do not...",N/A,N/A,en

Since its inception in 2002, SpaceX has sought to change the space launch paradigm by developing a family of launch vehicles that will ultimately reduce the cost and increase the reliability of space access tenfold. Coupled with the newly emerging market for governmental, private, and commercial space transport, this new model will re-ignite humanity's efforts to explore and develop space. Formed in 2002 by Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal and the Zip2 Corporation, SpaceX has already developed two state-of-the-art new launch vehicles, established an impressive launch manifest, and been awarded COTS funding by NASA to demonstrate delivery and return of cargo to the ISS. This book describes how simplicity, low-cost, and reliability can go hand in hand, as promoted in the philosophy of SpaceX. It explains how, by eliminating the traditional layers of internal management and external sub-contractors and keeping the vast majority of manufacturing in house, SpaceX reduces its costs while accelerating decision making and delivery, controls quality, and ensures constant liaison between the design and manufacturing teams.",N/A,N/A,en
The Entrepreneurial Mindset,"['Rita Gunther McGrath', 'Ian C. MacMillan']",2000,['Business & Economics'],"A Blueprint for Building Entrepreneurial Organizations Nobody needs to tell you that in the new economy, managers using conventional strategies are losing out to smart, fast, entrepreneurial competitors who move on ideas others overlook and who confidently act while others dither. Are the managers of leading companies simply doomed to let this happen? Not at all, argue Rita Gunther McGrath and Ian MacMillan. The fundamental problem is that the tools, training, and conceptual frameworks that work for business-as-usual can't, and don't, work when your main challenge is to bury old business models and aggressively create completely new ones. To succeed, today's strategists need the thought process and discipline that are second nature to successful entrepreneurs. The Entrepreneurial Mindset offers a refreshingly practical blueprint for thinking and acting in environments that are fast-paced, rapidly changing, and highly uncertain. It provides both a guide to energizing the organization to find tomorrow's opportunities and a set of entrepreneurial principles you can use personally to transform the arenas in which you compete. Using lessons drawn from leading entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial companies, The Entrepreneurial Mindset presents a set of practices for capitalizing on uncertainty and rapid change. Like McGrath and MacMillan's bestselling Harvard Business Review articles, such as ""Discovery-Driven Planning,"" the book provides simple but powerful ways to stop acting by the old rules and start thinking with the discipline of habitual entrepreneurs. The Entrepreneurial Mindset will show you how to: * Eliminate paralyzing uncertainty by creating an entrepreneurial frame that shapes a shared understanding of what is to be accomplished and what would be worthwhile * Create a richly stocked opportunity register in which you mobilize great ideas for redesigning existing products, finding new sources of differentiation, resegmenting existing markets, reconfiguring market spaces, and seizing the huge upside potential of breakthroughs * Build a dynamic portfolio of businesses and options that continuously move your organization toward the future * Execute dynamically your ideas so that you can move fast, with confidence and without undue risk * Develop your own way of leading with an entrepreneurial mindset to create a vibrant entrepreneurial climate within your organization The Entrepreneurial Mindset is about succeeding in an unpredictable world. It will help everyone from independent entrepreneurs to managers of large corporations develop insights that others overlook and act on them to build the truly entrepreneurial organizations of the future.",4.5,N/A,en

This collection reveals narratives of the colonial era that are often ignored or obscured by the national histories of former colonial powers. It charts the entrepreneurial routes chosen by various Norwegians and the places they ventured, while demonstrating the importance of recognizing the complicity of such 'non-colonial colonials' for understanding the complexity of colonial history""--Provided by publisher.",N/A,N/A,en

Unputdownable.' ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ __________ 'A satisfying ticktock of the company's rapid rise and crash.' New York Times 'Exposes the sheer madness of WeWork.' Sunday Times In its earliest days, WeWork promised the impossible: to make the workplace cool. Adam Neumann, an immigrant determined to make his fortune in the United States, landed on the idea of repurposing surplus New York office space for the burgeoning freelance class. Over the course of ten years, WeWork attracted billions of dollars from some of the most sought-after investors in the world, while spending it to build a global real estate empire. Based on more than two hundred interviews, Billion Dollar Loser chronicles the breakneck speed at which WeWork's CEO built and grew his company. Culminating in a day-by-day account of the five weeks leading up to WeWork's botched IPO and Neumann's dramatic ouster, Reeves Wiedeman exposes the story of the company's desperate attempt to secure the funding it needed in the final moments of a decade defined by excess. With incredible access and piercing insight into the company, Billion Dollar Loser tells the full, inside story of WeWork and its CEO Adam Neumann who together came to represent the most audacious, and improbable, rise and fall in business. 'A frisky dissection of how a rickety real-estate leasing company tricked the world into seeing it as an immensely valuable, society-shifting tech unicorn.'

"Entrepreneurship and Industry in India, 1800-1947",['Rajat Kanta Ray'],1992,['Business & Economics'],"When the new states of India and Pakistan attained independence in 1947, the economy of the subcontinent was backward, predominantly agricultural and characterized by massive poverty. Why this was so has been the subject of prolonged debate, going back to the acrimonious controversy between Lord Curzon and R.C. Dutt at the beginning of this century. But there were important developments in Indian business and industry later, especially the growth of modern industry under Indian enterprise between the world wars. At the time of independence, India possessed a large and fairly sophisticated modern industrial complex - in fact the biggest in the underdeveloped world. How this came to pass has been the subject of scholarly investigation and speculation since independence. This volume comprises some of the most important essays which focus on this theme, namely the emergence of entrepreneurs and industry in India over the colonial period. These essays, all by prominent historians or economists, also illustrate aspects of the investment behaviour of the various European and Indian communities (e.g. the Parsis and the Marwaris) involved in business and industry. In an extremely detailed and comprehensive Introduction, Professor Ray discusses the series of questions that have arisen on the history of Indian business and industry. Why did the linking of Indian capital to industry come so late? How was the bazaar kept distant from the bank? What benefits did European enterprise confer on India's economic development, if any? Why did the Bombay region become so important to the colonial economy? What were the major trends in production and employment? This book, like the other volumes in thisseries, will prove of great use to students and teachers of Indian history, as well as to anyone interested in India's business houses and industrial development.",N/A,N/A,en
