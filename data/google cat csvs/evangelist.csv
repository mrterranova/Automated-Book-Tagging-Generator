Heart Set Free,['Arnold Dallimore'],1988,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Charles Wesley is well known as the sweet singer of Methodism the most gifted and most prolific of all English hymnwriters. His hymns are an exhilarating expression of the evangelical faith and mood of the revival of the eighteenth century. His gift of expressing prayer and praise in great simplicity, and faithfully recording the ups and downs of the Christian life, has enriched and encouraged the whole church. It is, however, a popular misconception that Charles was the hymnwriter and his brother John the preacher. In this new biography Arnold Dallimore firmly establishes Charles as much more than just a poet and puts him in his rightful place in Methodisms history, as one of the most powerful of the open-air field preachers of the revival and an indefatigable evangelist who spoke in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.",N/A,N/A,en
