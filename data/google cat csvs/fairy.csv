Of Glass and Glamour,['Chanda Hahn'],2019-12-12,['Fiction'],"Born under a hunter's moon, abandoned as a child, I was raised to be a powerful sorceress-okay, a mediocre sorceress. All right, I'm good at glamour and can make things sparkle, if my spells don't backfire. It was foretold long ago that I was a child of prophecy that would unite the fae and humans of Candor. The only problem, no one told me, and now the king wants me dead. For I am Eden, one of the adoptive daughters of Lady Eville, and I have to attend the royal masquerade ball-not to win a prince, but to avenge my parents. Even if it means pretending to be a fairy godmother and wreaking a little havoc.",N/A,N/A,en
