The Historical Novel from Scott to Sabatini,['H. Orel'],1995-02-15,['Literary Criticism'],"Sir Walter Scott defined the parameters of the historical novel and illustrated his concept of the genre by writing a long series of novels dealing with medieval times, the Elizabethan Age and the 18th Century. Later novels written by his contemporaries and successors attracted smaller audiences. When Robert Louis Stevenson, in the early 1880s, enthusiastically expanded the boundaries of romantic fiction, he became a standard-bearer and an inspiration to many of his fellow-novelists: Walter Besant, Richard Doddridge Blackmore, Arthur Quiller-Couch, Arthur Conan Doyle, Stanley John Weyman, Anthony Hope, Henry Rider Haggard, and Rafael Sabatini.",N/A,N/A,en
The Historical Novel in Nineteenth-Century Europe,['Brian Hamnett'],2011-11-24,['History'],"Even at the height of its popularity in the early nineteenth century the historical novel faced criticism at many levels. After its predominance in the 1810s and 1820s writers and historians shunned it as a travesty of their respective disciplines. Even so, the historical novel has frequently attracted a wide-ranging public right up to the present day. Brian Hamnett examines key novels, by authors including Scott, Balzac, Manzoni, Dickens, Eliot, Flaubert, Fontane, Galdós, and Tolstoy, revealing the contradictions inherent in this form of fiction and exposing the challenges writers faced in attempting to represent a reality that linked past and present. He argues that the historical novel in the nineteenth century was a common European phenomenon with considerable interconnection of themes and periods. Accordingly, the book ranges from the British Isles and France through the Germanic territories, Italy and Spain, to the Russian Empire, identifying the different objectives and phases of the historical novel. Although historical novels did appear in the two previous centuries, the form came to maturity in the nineteenth century, a consequence of the developing nature of history as a discipline distinct from literature and philosophy, and the increasing primacy of the novel for writers and the reading public. Yet, the frontiers between history and literature remained blurred, and the two disciplines continued to influence one another as each sought a faithful representation of human experience.",N/A,N/A,en
The Woman's Historical Novel,['D.

"Tirant lo Blanch; a study of its authorship, principal sources and historical setting",['Joseph Anthony Vaeth'],2022-06-03,['Fiction'],"In 'Tirant lo Blanch; a study of its authorship, principal sources and historical setting,' Joseph Anthony Vaeth offers an exhaustive exploration of the renowned Valencian chivalric romance, 'Tirant lo Blanch.' Published in 1490, the original tale celebrates the knight-errant Tirant the White, a character who rises to become a heroic savior of the Byzantine Empire. Vaeth's scholarly work meticulously dissects the narrative's provenance, literary influences, and the geopolitical backdrop of its creation, employing a systematic academic approach. His examination provides invaluable insights into the intricate interplay between historical events and their representation in literature, inviting readers to appreciate the nuanced storytelling techniques of the era and the text's enduring literary merit within the context of Iberian chivalric traditions. Joseph Anthony Vaeth, an erudite scholar with a Columbia University pedigree, brings a discerning eye to 'Tirant lo Blanch.' His dissertation-turned-publication stems from a profound engagement with historical literature and a dedication to uncovering the roots of this chivalrous saga. Vaeth's academic rigor and thorough analysis of the romance's authorial origins illuminate the cultural exchanges and societal influences that shaped the narrative, offering an enlightening perspective on the literary landscape of late 15th-century Spain. This book is a treasure trove for both scholars and enthusiasts of chivalric romance and historical literature. Vaeth's deft scholarship renders 'Tirant lo Blanch' not only as a pivotal literary achievement but also as a mirror reflecting the complex historical and cultural currents of the time. His work is an indispensable resource for understanding the intricate layers of authorship and influence that define this storied text. The book is highly recommended for those seeking to deepen their knowledge of medieval European literature and the rich tapestry of history that underscores the genre's evolution.",N/A,N/A,en

It is 1947, and the long-retired Sherlock Holmes, now 93, lives in a remote Sussex farmhouse with his housekeeper and her young son. He tends to his bees, writes in his journal, and grapples with the diminishing powers of his mind. But in the twilight of his life, as people continue to look to him for answers, Holmes revisits a case that may provide him with answers of his own to questions he didn’t even know he was asking–about life, about love, and about the limits of the mind’s ability to know.

Some nineteenth-century heroines in the eighteenth century,['William Dean Howells'],1901,['Fiction'],"William Dean Howells (1837-1920), autodidact from the farmlands of Ohio, was a realist novelist, literary critic, and playwright, nicknamed ""The Dean of American Letters"". In his ""Editor's Study"" column at The Atlantic Monthly and, later, at Harper's, he formulated and disseminated his theories of ""realism"" in literature. Heroines of Fiction is a study of the characters of the female protagonists in the Anglo-American novel from Defoe to James. It is something of an anomaly in Howells's canon of literary texts for reasons of style, rhetorical stance, and purpose. As a critic, Howells was less concerned with psychological or social realism than with an ideal of human character, and in this collection, expands that concern with character within a thesis asserting that ""a novel is great or not, as its women are important or unimportant."" These character 'portraits' illustrate Howells impressions of which of these female characters are important, and how this status is achieved.",N/A,N/A,en

PSYCHOTHERAPY,['HUGO MÜNSTERBERG'],1909,['Fiction'],"This volume on psychotherapy belongs to a series of books which I am writing to discuss for a wider public the practical applications of modern psychology. The first book, called ""On the Witness Stand,"" studied the relations of scientific psychology to crime and the law courts. This new book deals with the relations of psychology to medicine. Others discussing its relations to education, to social problems, to commerce and industry will follow soon. For popular treatment I divide applied psychology into such various, separated books because they naturally address very different audiences. That which interests the lawyer does not concern the physician, and again the school-teacher has his own sphere of interests. Moreover the different subjects demand a different treatment. The problems of psychology and law were almost entirely neglected. I was anxious to draw wide attention to this promising field and therefore I chose the form of loose popular essays without any aim towards systematic presentation of the subject. As to psychology and medicine almost the opposite situation prevails. There is perhaps too much talk afloat about psychotherapy, the widest circles cultivate the discussion, the magazines[Pg viii] overflow with it. The duty of the scientific psychologist is accordingly not to stir up interest in this topic but to help in bringing this interest from mere gossip, vague mysticism, and medical amateurishness to a clear understanding of principles. What is needed in this time of faith cures of a hundred types is to deal with the whole circle of problems in a serious, systematic way and to emphasize the aspect of scientific psychological theory. Hence the whole first part of this book is an abstract discussion and its first chapters have not even any direct relation to disease. I am convinced that both physicians and ministers and all who are in practical contact with these important questions ought to be brought to such painstaking and perhaps fatiguing inquiry into principles before the facts are reached. To those who seek a discussion of life facts alone, the whole first part will of course appear to be a tedious way around; they may turn directly to the second and third parts. One word for my personal right to deal with these questions, as too much illegitimate psychotherapeutics is heard to-day. For me, the relation between psychology and medicine is not a chance chapter of my science to which I have turned simply in following up the various sides of applied psychology. And still less have I turned to it because it has become the fashion in recent years. On the contrary, it has been an important factor in all my work since my student days. I have been through five years of regular medical studies, three years in Leipzig and two years[Pg ix] in Heidelberg; I have an M.D. degree from the University of Heidelberg. In my first year as docent in a German university twenty years ago, I gave throughout the winter semester before several hundred students a course in hypnotism and its medical application. It was probably the first university course on hypnotism given anywhere. Since that time I have never ceased to work psychotherapeutically in the psychological laboratory. Yet that must not be misunderstood. I have no clinic, and while by principle I have never hypnotized anyone for mere experiment's sake but always only for medical purposes, yet I adjust my practical work entirely to the interests of my scientific study. The limitations of my time force me to refuse the psychotherapeutic treatment of any case which has not a certain scientific interest for me, and of the many hundreds whom I have helped in the laboratory, no one ever had to pay anything. Thus my practical work has strictly the character of laboratory research. The chief aim of this book is twofold. It is a negative one: I want to counteract the misunderstandings which overflood the whole field, especially by the careless mixing of mental and moral influence. And a positive one: I want to strengthen the public feeling that the time has come when every physician should systematically study psychology, the normal in the college years and the abnormal in the medical school. This demand of medical education cannot be postponed any longer. The aim of the book is not to fight the Emmanuel Church Movement, or[Pg x] even Christian Science or any other psychotherapeutic tendency outside of the field of scientific medicine. I see the element of truth in all of them, but they ought to be symptoms of transition. Scientific medicine should take hold of psychotherapeutics now or a most deplorable disorganization will set in, the symptoms of which no one ought to overlook to-day.",N/A,N/A,en

Dead Souls,['Nikolaĭ Vasilʹevich Gogolʹ'],1929,['Fiction'],"Nikolai Gogol's ""Dead Souls"" is the great comic masterpiece of Russian literature-a satirical and splendidly exaggerated epic of life in the benighted provinces. Gogol hoped to show the world ""the untold riches of the Russian soul"" in this 1842 novel, which he populated with a Dickensian swarm of characters: rogues and scoundrels, landowners and serfs, conniving petty officials-all of them both utterly lifelike and alarmingly larger than life. Setting everything in motion is the wily antihero, Chichikov, the trafficker in ""dead souls""-deceased serfs who still represent profit to those clever enough to trade in them.

Without supplies and out of food, the party sent out two men, William Manley (1820-1903) and John Haney Rogers (1822-1906), to seek rescue.

Naomi Jacobs addresses this question in a study of writers such as William Styron, E. L. Doctorow, and Robert Coover, who challenge the dominance of nonfiction by populating their fictions with real people, living and dead. Jacobs explores the genesis, varieties, and implications of this trend in a prose as lively as that of the writers she critiques. Using as a case study Robert Coover’s portrait of Richard Nixon in The Public Burning, Jacobs addresses the important legal and ethical questions raised by this trend and applies contemporary libel law to the fictionalization of living people, such as Richard Nixon. She closes her study by speculating on the future of this device and of the novel.",N/A,N/A,en

She enjoyed her new position vastly, was blithe as a young bird, and gazed fearlessly on into a future, which seemed an interminable vista paved with roses. Nor was she the least spoilt by adulation. She liked flattery, as every pretty woman does, but looked forward at no very distant period to the sober, substantial enjoyment of calm domestic happiness. When it pleased her parents to provide a spouse, she was prepared to take him to her heart as a dutiful daughter should, and lavish on him all the treasures of a young and guileless affection.""",N/A,N/A,en

Rob Roy,['Walter Scott'],2015-07-03,[],"Rob Roy by Sir Walter Scott - Complete Version - NEW EDITION - The story takes place just before the Jacobite rising of 1715, with much of Scotland in turmoil. Frank Osbaldistone, the narrator, quarrels with his father and is sent to stay with an uncle, Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone, in Northumberland. Frank falls in love with Diana Vernon, Sir Hildebrand's niece, whose father has been forced to go into hiding because of his Jacobite sympathies. Frank's cousin, Rashleigh, steals important documents vital to the honour and economic solvency of Frank's father, William, and Frank pursues Rashleigh to Scotland. Several times his path crosses the mysterious and powerful figure Rob Roy MacGregor, known as Rob Roy, an associate of Sir Hildebrand. There is much confusion as the action shifts to the beautiful mountains and valleys around Loch Lomond. A British army detachment is ambushed and there is bloodshed. The eponymous Rob Roy is badly wounded at the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719, in which a British army of Scots and English defeat a Jacobite and Spanish expedition that aimed to restore the Stuart monarchy. All of Sir Hildebrand's sons but Rashleigh are killed in the Jacobite rising, and Rashleigh, too meets a bloody end. Following this, Frank inherits Sir Hildebrand's property and marries Diana.

"The Knights of the Cross, Or, Kryzacy",['Henryk Sienkiewicz'],2020-04-02,[],"In Tyniec, in the inn under ""Dreadful Urus,"" which belonged to the abbey, a few people were sitting, listening to the talk of a military man who had come from afar, and was telling them of the adventures which he had experienced during the war and his journey. He had a large beard but he was not yet old, and he was almost gigantic but thin, with broad shoulders; he wore his hair in a net ornamented with beads; he was dressed in a leather jacket, which was marked by the cuirass, and he wore a belt composed of brass buckles; in the belt he had a knife in a horn scabbard, and at his side a short traveling sword. Near by him at the table, was sitting a youth with long hair and joyful look, evidently his comrade, or perhaps a shield-bearer, because he also was dressed as for a journey in a similar leather jacket. The rest of the company was composed of two noblemen from the vicinity of Krakow and of three townsmen with red folding caps, the thin tops of which were hanging down their sides to their elbows.",N/A,N/A,en
