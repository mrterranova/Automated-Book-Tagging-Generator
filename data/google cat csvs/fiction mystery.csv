Aus dem Buch: ""Er wußte selbst nicht, wie er dazu gekommen war! Aber eines Abends fand er sich plötzlich in einer verräucherten Kneipe, zwischen Matrosen und allerlei zweideutigem Gesindel, schmierige Karten auf die unsaubere Tischplatte hauend. Er fluchte wie sie, spuckte wie sie und gröhlte gleich ihnen, wenn eine größere Summe aus der Bank in seine Hände floß. Dann bestellte er Schnaps für die ganze Korona, denn er hatte den Gewinn nicht nötig und brauchte vorläufig nicht davon zu leben, was ihm die Glücksblättchen in den Schoß warfen. Das war, wie gesagt, der Anfang. Aber es blieb nicht dabei. Einmal ließ er sich seinen Frack abbürsten, telephonierte nach einem Auto und fuhr ins Kasino de Paris. Da war es anders als in den Kaschemmen, denn die Herren trugen gestärkte Hemdbrüste, die Frauen hatten wenig an und die Schritte ertranken in tiefen Persern. Statt Schnaps trank man Sekt und statt um ein paar lumpige Franken ging es auf Hunderte, Tausende, und wenn man wollte – Millionen! – Dieses aber hatte Erwin Gerardi gesucht. Er setzte sich an einen Tisch, an dem gerade ein Platz frei wurde, goß drei Glas Champagner hinunter und begann zu jeuen. Erwin Gerardi war nämlich einer jener unverbesserlichen Käuze, die sich einbilden, ein System erfunden zu haben, nach dem sich ohne Verlust und mit viel Gewinn spielen läßt. Er hatte es in den Kaschemmen erprobt und wollte nun auch im großen Stile davon Gebrauch machen.""

Three high school friends are able to do two things no one else on the planet can do . . . talk with dead people and time travel to the past. For Kelly, it’s a major adjustment to move from the only life she has ever known in Texas to live with her aunt in Ft. Myers Beach, Florida. She quickly makes friends with her quirky next door neighbor, Scott and his best friend, Austin. In her aunt’s garage, they find a long-lost invention of Thomas Edison called “The Telephone to the Dead”. Edison had abandoned the project and given it to Kelly’s great-great-grandfather. Scott tinkers with it until they can hear sounds coming from it. But instead of broadcasting music . . . it picks up conversations from the dead. As they slowly turn the dial they hear hundreds of sad, lonely voices of souls that have passed but apparently never moved on, pleading for help. A teenager’s voice separates from the rest and begs for their help to clear her reputation. They are shocked to find out that she had gone to their own high school . . . 47 years ago. They research the girl’s story and discover that her name was Wendy and she had been a popular cheerleader who had apparently committed suicide. The teens are touched by Wendy’s cries and pleas, but they have no way to go back in time to help her. That is, until Scott reveals an nvention of his own . . . a time travel app. Kelly and Austin are very skeptical. Even Scott isn’t sure it will work, so they try it out on his sister’s pet turtle. Amazingly, the turtle disappears. But did it travel to the past or just wander off? Finally, they decide to humor Scott and go along with his claims of time travel. They meet on the beach after everyone else has gone home. They stand in the formation Scott insists will create the perfect vortex for time travel. At the last moment, a fourth person runs forward and is pulled into their adventure back to 1966. They figure out a way to get close to Wendy without her asking too many questions that they can’t answer. But as they discover the secret to her death, they find it’s not as clear-cut as it would seem. A romance gone wrong, an over-attentive teacher and a young girl’s dreams for the future are all twisted into a mystery that causes the teens to take greater risks than they could have imagined. It all becomes very real when their own lives are in danger and they realize they may never make it back to the present. OMG – Winner of the Best Indie Book of 2013 for Young Adults and Finalist in the 2013 Beverly Hills Book Awards. Well plotted and fast paced.

Reading The Monogram Murders was like returning to a favorite room of a long-lost home.” — Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl Hercule Poirot returns home after an agreeable luncheon to find an angry woman waiting to berate him outside his front door. Her name is Sylvia Rule, and she demands to know why Poirot has accused her of the murder of Barnabas Pandy, a man she has neither heard of nor ever met. She is furious to be so accused, and deeply shocked. Poirot is equally shocked, because he too has never heard of any Barnabas Pandy, and he certainly did not send the letter in question. He cannot convince Sylvia Rule of his innocence, however, and she marches away in a rage. Shaken, Poirot goes inside, only to find that he has a visitor waiting for him — a man called John McCrodden who also claims also to have received a letter from Poirot that morning, accusing him of the murder of Barnabas Pandy... Poirot wonders how many more letters of this sort have been sent in his name. Who sent them, and why? More importantly, who is Barnabas Pandy, is he dead, and, if so, was he murdered? And can Poirot find out the answers without putting more lives in danger?",N/A,N/A

Beaton's beloved Agatha Raisin mystery cozy series—now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television. Unlike quite a number of people, Agatha had not given up on Christmas. To have the perfect Christmas had been a childhood dream whilst surviving a rough upbringing in a Birmingham slum. Holly berries glistened, snow fell gently outside, and inside, all was Dickensian jollity. And in her dreams, James Lacey kissed her under the mistletoe, and, like a middle-aged sleeping beauty, she would awake to passion once more.... Agatha Raisin is bored. Her detective agency in the Cotswolds is thriving, but she'll scream if she has to deal with another missing cat or dog. Only two things seem to offer potential excitement: the upcoming Christmas festivities and her ex, James Lacey. This year she is sure that if she invites James to a really splendid, old-fashioned Christmas dinner, their love will rekindle like a warm Yule log. When a wealthy widow hires Agatha because she's convinced a member of her family is trying to kill her, Agatha is intrigued---especially when the widow drops dead after high tea at the manor house. Who in this rather sterile house, complete with fake family portraits, could have hated the old lady enough to poison her? Agatha sets out to find the murderer, all the while managing a pretty, teenage trainee who makes her feel old and planning for a picture-perfect Christmas, with James, all the trimmings, and perhaps even snow.",N/A,N/A

I'm a former high school counsellor, middle-child peacemaker, and curator of lots of squishy/fuzzy goodness at my granddad's little yarn store. The Serial Knitters and Happy Hookers in the store's Craft for Calmness group have been busy creating booties and baby blankets for a christening fit for a prince. But when I stumble onto the little prince's fatally poisoned mother, a right royal mess ensues. The kid's paternity is in question and I'm tasked to sniff out the baby daddy as a favour for a frenemy--don't ask. I did, and now the bodies are piling up and a killer just might use my cupcake addiction against me. Tessa Wakefield has her hands full juggling a cozy craft store, her crazy family, and two men who'd rather poke out their eyes than describe themselves as cute. Which they totally are. Cute, charismatic, and occasionally on her mind when she's not stumbling over dead bodies and using her newfound sleuthing skills to track down murderers. Lucky she's an excellent multi-tasker because digging beneath Cape Discovery's surface can unearth secrets that kill.",N/A,N/A

The winter solstice is an important day in folk lore, in Jenny's life and that of Fenwick. The only constant in a suddenly changed world is the library and here both police and suspects begin to congregate, following separate paths through a historical shadow of what the town used to be, a memory of the past. Marshall attempts to solve a crime in a situation that is far beyond anything he has ever imagined; doing his best to be a good policeman in a place where laws have no meaning. Music, myth and magic again interweave with the darkness of a crime novel to provide Marshall with a long night and journey home. Praise for Journeyman: Here's what I like most about British urban fantasy: It hasn't forsaken a sense of wonder - the feeling that mythological figures and magic inspires a mix of awe, dread, and delight - Melville's a terrific writer. The mythological / folkloric / ghostly bits were particularly wonderful and ... if you're as much of a lover of libraries as I am, you'll be delighted by The Smith Foundation in Fenwick.

All Men Glad and Wise,['Laura C. Stevenson'],2022-04-19,[],"The steward of Willingford Hall was murdered in the Dell on 12 March 1919. I found his body because I'd been thrown by a horse. It's difficult to say which event was more unlikely. Willingford Hall stable lad Harry Green is about to make a discovery even more unlikely than a corpse. With the estate near bankruptcy and the rise of automobiles fast replacing horse travel, Harry, a young woman passing as a lad, will soon be out of a job. Facing the knowledge she has no skills in the service positions open to women, Harry resolves to discover who murdered the steward, thus becoming a woman who can determine her own future. But as her investigation proceeds, a second murder demonstrates just how dangerous her knowledge is. Soon, no matter where she rides, she finds that somebody is following her. Part coming-of-age and part cozy mystery, All Men Glad and Wise confronts a time of tremendous social change: the inequities of service jobs, the quandaries of grooms as technology advances, and the patriarchal assumptions that exclude women from both valued work and riding astride. Harry, like horsemanship, and like England, is on the cusp of a world looking forward.",N/A,N/A
