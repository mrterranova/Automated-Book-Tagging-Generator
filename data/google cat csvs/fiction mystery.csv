A small town named after a nineteenth-century traitor. A feisty antiques shop owner with a passion for authenticity. A freelance journalist with a penchant for the truth. Join amateur sleuths Arabella Carpenter and Emily Garland in the not-so-sleepy village of Lount’s Landing, where secrets, subterfuge, and real estate wranglings sometimes lead to murder. The Hanged Man’s Noose (#1) Freelance writer Emily Garland is cash-strapped, newly single, and tired of reporting on the same old condo stats. When she’s offered a lucrative assignment in the village of Lount’s Landing, she decides to take a chance. All she has to do is relocate and uncover the real story behind a proposed redevelopment plan. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty, as it turns out. Not everyone is happy with real estate mogul Garrett Stonehaven’s plans to convert an old schoolhouse into a mega-box store. At the top of the list is Arabella Carpenter, the outspoken owner of The Glass Dolphin antiques shop, who will do just about anything to preserve the integrity of the town’s historic Main Street. But Arabella is not alone in her opposition. Before long, a vocal dissenter dies. A few days later, another body is discovered.

With means, opportunity, and more than enough motive, he soon becomes the police department’s prime suspect, leaving Arabella and Emily determined to clear his name—even if they’re not entirely convinced of his innocence. Dogged by incriminating online posts from an anonymous blogger, they track down leads from Emily’s ex-fiancé (and the woman he left Emily for), an Elvis impersonator, and a retired antiques mall vendor with a secret of her own.

Sophie Hannah had a massive challenge in reviving the beloved Poirot, and she met it with heart and no small amount of little grey cells. I was thrilled to see the Belgian detective in such very, very good hands. Reading The Monogram Murders was like returning to a favorite room of a long-lost home.” — Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl Hercule Poirot returns home after an agreeable luncheon to find an angry woman waiting to berate him outside his front door. Her name is Sylvia Rule, and she demands to know why Poirot has accused her of the murder of Barnabas Pandy, a man she has neither heard of nor ever met. She is furious to be so accused, and deeply shocked. Poirot is equally shocked, because he too has never heard of any Barnabas Pandy, and he certainly did not send the letter in question. He cannot convince Sylvia Rule of his innocence, however, and she marches away in a rage. Shaken, Poirot goes inside, only to find that he has a visitor waiting for him — a man called John McCrodden who also claims also to have received a letter from Poirot that morning, accusing him of the murder of Barnabas Pandy... Poirot wonders how many more letters of this sort have been sent in his name. Who sent them, and why? More importantly, who is Barnabas Pandy, is he dead, and, if so, was he murdered? And can Poirot find out the answers without putting more lives in danger?",N/A,N/A,en

Through Three Rooms,['Sven Elvestad'],2023-04-27,['Fiction'],"It’s a cold and dark winter afternoon when a doctor knocks on detective Asbjørn Krag’s door. He’s worried about his patient, who has turned overnight from a cheerful, eccentric elderly gentleman into a shivering wreck. Clearly he’s terrified – but can a series of minor incidents at his isolated country house really be the cause? And why won’t he tell anyone what he fears? Krag must go undercover as a guest at an isolated Norwegian mansion to try prevent a murder in its snowy grounds, and to find the secret behind the three mysterious rooms. Sven Elvestad, who also wrote under the pseudonym Stein Riverton, was one of Norway’s greatest crime writers. A journalist by training, he was the first foreign journalist to interview Adolf Hitler and was famous for stunts such as spending a day in a circus lion’s cage. His first novel was published in 1907 and he went on to write nearly a hundred novels, many featuring detective Asbjørn Krag. Only a few of his works have ever been translated into English, despite enjoying widespread success across Europe. Norway’s yearly Riverton prize for the best crime novel is named after him. This new translation features an introduction by Nils Nordberg, radio drama producer and Norwegian authority on crime fiction. “A brisk, pacey and thoroughly entertaining page-turner by one of crime fiction’s unsung heroes…well worth rediscovering.” – Tom Mead, author of Death and the Conjuror “An enjoyable example of the traditional murder mystery.”– Martin Edwards, novelist and author of The Life of Crime",N/A,N/A,en

At this time, the street had gained notoriety as a place frequented by prostitutes and criminals.",N/A,N/A,en

When a gorgeous young actress dies on the Red Carpet, some in Tinseltown call it bad publicity. Max calls it murder. The Academy Awards®. It's Hollywood's biggest night, and there's no star better equipped than the tart-tongued Max Taylor to hold court on the glamorous Red Carpet.

And tonight, Max has landed a real coup—an exclusive interview with Halsey Hamilton, a fabulous, young, paparazzi-trailed Oscar nominee. But not even Max, who's seen her share of celebrity train wrecks, is prepared for an incoherent Halsey, straight out of rehab, to stumble up to the mic, slur a few cryptic words, and drop dead at the hem of Max's stunning Michael Kors gown.

After all, she alone heard Halsey's final whisper—a clue that leads Max to the pricey rehab clinic Wonders. With a weakness for nothing more disturbing than artificial sweeteners, Max nonetheless goes undercover and embarks on a twelve-step investigation into murder. Once inside the luxury clinic, Max's list of suspicious players expands faster than the Jolie-Pitt family: Burke Norris, a professional cad and Drew's ex-fiancé; Halsey's father, who is still making money off his dead daughter's fame; Halsey's jealous younger sister; and Rojo Bernstein, a tattooed karate hipster who knew the troubled fallen star much better than anyone suspected.

The Czar's Spy,['William Le Queux'],2021-08-10,['Fiction'],"The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love (1905) is an espionage adventure novel by Anglo-French writer William Le Queux. Published at the beginning of Le Queux's career as a leading author of popular thrillers, The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love is a story of international espionage, mystery, and forbidden romance. Using his own research and experience as a journalist and adventurer, Le Queux crafts an accessible, entertaining tale for readers in search of a literary escape. Known for his works of fiction and nonfiction on the possibility of Germany invading Britain--a paranoia common in the early twentieth century--William Le Queux also wrote dozens of thrillers and adventure novels for a dedicated public audience. Although critical acclaim eluded him, popular success made him one of England's bestselling writers. In The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love, a British aristocrat named Gordon Gregg is hired by the Czar of Russia to conduct an investigation of various European prisons. Traveling from Russia to Finland, England, and Italy, Gregg hones his skills as an international spy while indulging his taste for adventure and romance--at the risk of his life. In Italy, pursuing a lead, Gregg boards a mysterious yacht, where he discovers a photograph of a beautiful woman. Overwhelmed with attraction, Gregg swears to an oath to find her, whatever the cost. Rugged and individualistic, suave and hopelessly romantic, Gordon Gregg seems a prototype for such heroes as James Bond and George Smiley. The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love is a throwback to the simpler days of entertainment, a bestseller that holds up over a century after it appeared in print. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of William Le Queux's The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love is a classic work of adventure fiction reimagined for modern readers.",N/A,N/A,en

Unabridged (100% Original content) Font adjustments & biography included Illustrated The Mystery of the Sea by Bram Stoker The Mystery of the Sea, a novel by Bram Stoker, was originally published in 1902. Stoker is best known for his 1897 novel Dracula, but The Mystery of the Sea contains many of the same compelling elements. It tells the story of an Englishman living in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, who meets and falls in love with an American heiress. She is involved with the intrigues of the Spanish-American War, and a complex plot involving Second Sight, kidnapping, and secret codes unfolds over the course of the novel. The Mystery of the Sea contains supernatural elements, but is in many respects a political thriller. Stoker draws from personal experience and incorporates historical strands from the Spanish-American War as well as the sixteenth-century conflict between Spain and Elizabethan England, using these events to explore important themes of his time such as national identity and changing concepts of womanhood. Although The Mystery of the Sea received many favorable reviews when it was published (and many of the criticisms it received could be equally well applied to Dracula), it has been significantly overshadowed in scholarship and criticism by Dracula. Plot: Archibald Hunter, a young Englishman, is passing his leisure time near Cruden Bay in the small Scottish village of Whinnyfold when he has a vision of a couple walking past him, carrying a tiny coffin. Archibald also notices a strange old woman watching him. Later, he finds out that his vision has come true, and a child in town has died. Archibald encounters the bizarre old woman again on the seashore; this woman, who introduces herself as Gormala MacNeil, knows that Archibald saw something out of the ordinary. She proceeds to explain that she has ""Second Sight""-a sort of psychic ability for premonition that comes and goes at random-and that she can tell that Archibald, too, is a Seer. Fluctuating between skepticism and uneasiness over his newfound abilities, Archibald listens to Gormala's insights and sees one of his visions fulfilled at Lammas-tide, when he and Gormala witness Lauchlane Macleod, a local fisherman, wreck his boat on a chain of sharp rocks known as the Skares. Archibald sees a procession of dead spirits emerge from the water near the Skares and make its way up the cliffs. About a year later, Archibald has returned to Cruden Bay and is preparing a permanent residence there. He buys a trunk from an auctioneer on the street (where he again encounters Gormala) and finds that the trunk contains letters from the late 16th and early 17th centuries. While near the seashore, Archibald notices two ladies stranded on a rock out in the ocean. He helps them get back to shore, and learns that one of the ladies is an elderly woman named Mrs. Jack, and the other a young, beautiful woman named Marjory, an American who has a strong aversion to Spaniards. Archibald feels himself falling in love with Marjory instantly. Later, Marjory helps Archibald decode the letters that he found in the trunk, which are written in a complicated cipher (Bacon's cipher).

All Men Glad and Wise,['Laura C. Stevenson'],2022-04-19,[],"The steward of Willingford Hall was murdered in the Dell on 12 March 1919. I found his body because I'd been thrown by a horse. It's difficult to say which event was more unlikely. Willingford Hall stable lad Harry Green is about to make a discovery even more unlikely than a corpse. With the estate near bankruptcy and the rise of automobiles fast replacing horse travel, Harry, a young woman passing as a lad, will soon be out of a job. Facing the knowledge she has no skills in the service positions open to women, Harry resolves to discover who murdered the steward, thus becoming a woman who can determine her own future. But as her investigation proceeds, a second murder demonstrates just how dangerous her knowledge is. Soon, no matter where she rides, she finds that somebody is following her. Part coming-of-age and part cozy mystery, All Men Glad and Wise confronts a time of tremendous social change: the inequities of service jobs, the quandaries of grooms as technology advances, and the patriarchal assumptions that exclude women from both valued work and riding astride. Harry, like horsemanship, and like England, is on the cusp of a world looking forward.",N/A,N/A,en
