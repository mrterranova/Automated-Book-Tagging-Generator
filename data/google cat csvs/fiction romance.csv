"Robert Louis Stevenson, Science, and the Fin de Siècle",['J. Reid'],2006-06-28,['Literary Criticism'],"In this fascinating book, Reid examines Robert Louis Stevenson's writings in the context of late-Victorian evolutionist thought, arguing that an interest in 'primitive' life is at the heart of his work. She investigates a wide range of Stevenson's writing, including Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Treasure Island as well as previously unpublished material from the Stevenson archive at Yale. Reid's interpretation offers a new way of understanding the relationship between his Scottish and South Seas work. Her analysis of Stevenson's engagement with anthropological and psychological debate also illuminates the dynamic intersections between literature and science at the fin de siècle.",N/A,N/A
Stories and Poems,['Rudyard Kipling'],2015-10-08,['Fiction'],"'Hear and attend and listen...' Rudyard Kipling is a supreme master of the short story in English and a poet of brilliant gifts. His energy and inventiveness poured themselves into every kind of tale, from the bleakest of fables to the richest of comedies, and he illuminated every aspect of human behaviour, of which he was a fascinated (and sometimes appalled) observer. This generous selection of stories and poems, first published in the acclaimed Oxford Authors series, covers the full range of Kipling's career from the youthful volumes that brought him fame as the chronicler of British India, to the bittersweet fruits of age and bereavement in the aftermath of the First World War. It includes stories such as 'The Man who would be King', 'Mrs Bathurst', and 'Mary Postgate', and poems from Barrack-Room Ballads and other collections. In his introduction and notes Daniel Karlin addresses the controversial political engagement of Kipling's art, and the sources of its imaginative power.",N/A,N/A
On Comics and Grief,['Dale Jacobs'],2024-05-16,['Fiction'],"Fragmented and hybrid in style, On Comics and Grief examines a year in comic book publishing and the author’s grief surrounding his mother’s death. This book connects grief, memory, nostalgia, personal history, theory, and multiple lines of comics studies inquiry in relation to the comic books of 1976. Structured around a year of comic books with a cover date of 1976, the year the author turned ten, the book is divided into an Introduction plus twelve sections, each a month of the publishing year. Two comic books are highlighted each month and examined through the interwoven lenses of creative nonfiction and comics studies. Through these twenty-four comics, the book addresses the major comic book publishers and virtually all genres of comics published in 1976. By pushing the ways in which the personal is used in comics studies, combining different modes of writing, and embracing a fragmentary style, the book explores what is possible in academic writing in general and comics studies in particular. On Comics and Grief both acts as a way for the author to process his grief and uses grief as a way to think about the comics themselves through the emotions and personal connections that underlie the work we do as scholars.",N/A,N/A
Historical Dictionary of Fantasy Literature,['Allen Stroud'],2023-06-12,['Literary Criticism'],"Fantasy is both old and new. In the ancient past, stories of magic, where supernatural creatures existed, the gods walked the earth and heroes saved their civilizations from the dark fate that awaited them were intermingled with history, religion, and fact. It is only in the last few hundred years that a conscious suspension of disbelief has allowed us to return to fantasy: the literature of the impossible and appreciate it for its craft and storytelling once more. Historical Dictionary of Fantasy Literature, Second Edition contains a chronology, an introduction, an extensive bibliography, and cross-referenced entries on more than 800 authors, ranging across the entire historical spectrum. More than 200 other entries describe the fantasy sub genres, key images in fantasy literature, technical terms used in fantasy criticism, and the intimately convoluted relationship between literary fantasies, scholarly fantasies, and lifestyle fantasies. This book is an excellent resource for students, researchers, and anyone wanting to know more about fantasy literature.",N/A,N/A

After Austen,['Lisa Hopkins'],2018-11-11,['Literary Criticism'],"This collection of twelve new essays examines some of what Jane Austen has become in the two hundred years since her death. Some of the chapters explore adaptations or repurposings of her work while others trace her influence on a surprising variety of different kinds of writing, sometimes even when there is no announced or obvious debt to her. In so doing they also inevitably shed light on Austen herself. Austen is often considered romantic and not often considered political, but both those perceptions are challenged her, as is the idea that she is primarily a writer for and about women. Her books are comic and ironic, but they have been reworked and drawn upon in very different genres and styles. Collectively these essays testify to the extraordinary versatility and resonance of Austen’s books.",N/A,N/A

The Jewels of Kinfairlie Boxed Set,['Claire Delacroix'],2013-01-09,['Fiction'],"Four magical medieval romances from the “Queen of Medieval Romance”, Claire Delacroix. Meet the siblings in the mischievous and loving family at Kinfairlie and follow their adventures in pursuit of true love. In The Beauty Bride, Madeline is appalled by her older brother’s determination to see her wed against her will. When he auctions her hand to an outlawed mercenary, she flees them both, certain that her fate cannot be worse. But Rhys FitzHenry is not a man to abandon what he holds dear, and Madeline’s proud beauty has captured his heart. Can a rough knight enchant her with stories and convince her to be his wife in truth, or will his enemies have their vengeance first? In The Rose Red Bride, Vivienne is convinced that only destiny could bring such a wondrous secret lover to her chamber, but with morning’s light, her lover abducts her. Erik knows that justice can only be gained from the Lammergeier with force, especially as the fate of his young daughters hangs in the balance. Can Vivienne help this wounded highlander to regain his legacy, and win his heart for her own? In The Snow White Bride, Eleanor seeks sanctuary at Kinfairlie on Christmas Eve. The Laird of Kinfairlie’s sisters decide that the beautiful widow will be the perfect match for their brother. Alexander’s heart is quickly lost, but as Eleanor’s secrets are revealed, he fears he has trusted too much too soon. Will Eleanor’s past jeopardize the future of this knight who has claimed her heart, or can she save him from the peril that follows her? This digital boxed set includes all three medieval romances in the Jewels of Kinfairlie trilogy – The Beauty Bride, The Rose Red Bride, The Snow White Bride – as well as the linked short story, The Ballad of Rosamunde. ***** I’ve written many series set in my fictional medieval Scottish world of Ravensmuir, Kinfairlie and Inverfyre. This is the order in which the stories take place, although you can start with any series. I recommend you read each series in order. There’s a tab on my website for ALL books in this world: http://delacroix.net/ravensmuir/ I. The Rogues of Ravensmuir This is the first series to take place in this world. These three books are a bit more gothic in tone and less tightly linked to each other than the books in subsequent series. 1. The Rogue Merlyn and Ysabella’s story is a second chance romance with a bit of intrigue and suspense. Their relationship is a class war - he’s the laird and she’s a village girl - but there’s an immediate attraction between them. Can Merlyn trust in love at first sight? Can Ysabella trust her rogue of a husband when he returns five years after their parting to ask for her help? This is the first book featuring Ravensmuir and in it, we learn the story of its sister holding, Kinfairlie. 2. The Scoundrel Can a notorious bad boy like Merlyn’s brother Gawain be redeemed by love? In this story, Gawain meets his match, the enticing Eglantine, who is not just as adept a thief as he is but is prepared to seduce him to regain the prize she desires. This is cat-and-mouse story of action, adventure and intrigue takes us from York to the highlands of Scotland, to Eglantine’s home at Inverfyre. 3. The Warrior At the end of The Scoundrel, Inverfyre is lost to the notorious MacLaren clan, but years later, Eglantine and Gawain’s son Michael - the Hawk of Inverfyre - returns to reclaim his legacy. He has need of an heir so he abducts Aileen to be his bride, never guessing that these two have shared a great passion in their past lives. At Inverfyre, Aileen is plagued by visions and fears she is going mad, while the Hawk is uncertain whether his beguiling new bride can be trusted—or whether she has let the MacLarens in the gate. This medieval Scottish romance has some fantasy elements as it’s a reincarnation story. II. The Jewels of Kinfairlie At the end of The Warrior, there is a family gathering at Inverfyre. We briefly meet Merlyn and Ysabella’s son Roland, his wife Catherine, and their eight children. This series begins several years later, after Roland and Catherine’s tragic death, when their oldest son Alexander suddenly becomes laird. The treasury is empty. The harvest will be poor. Alexander needs to see his sisters married as quickly as possible, but they wish to wed for love. 1. The Beauty Bride Alexander arranges an auction for the hand of his defiant sister, intending to manage the list of bidders - but a notorious mercenary, Rhys fitzHenry, pays the highest price. This arranged marriage doesn’t begin well, as Madeline is a runaway bride, but Rhys pursues her, saves her, and tries to court her. I love that Rhys tells Madeline stories to win her heart, and that she quickly figures out that each choice of story reveals one of her husband’s secrets. 2. The Rose Red Bride Alexander thinks he’s learned his lesson and is thrilled when Vivienne’s former suitor, Nicholas Sinclair, wants to claim her hand. It’s a little uncommon that Nicholas wants to abduct his bride, but Alexander is sure that Vivienne will think that a romantic gesture, and when the wedding is held in the morning, all will be well. But the highlander seeking Alexander’s agreement isn’t Nicholas - it’s his brother Erik in disguise, a man who needs a wife only because he needs a son to claim his legacy. He’s not counting on Vivienne stealing his heart, too. 3. The Snow White Bride It’s Christmas at Kinfairlie and a mysterious noblewoman seeks refuge in the chapel. When the sisters learn that she’s a widow in need of protection, they decide to play a trick on Alexander and arrange his marriage. Eleanor thinks husbands are all the same, so is agreeable, although she isn’t counting on Alexander’s youth, charm, and desire to claim her heart. When her past catches up to her and Kinfairlie is at risk, how much will Eleanor sacrifice to see her new husband safe? What price will Alexander pay to defend his bride? 4. The Ballad of Rosamunde Rosamunde, the pirate queen and aunt of the siblings at Kinfairlie, was adopted by Gawain in The Scoundrel and trapped in the realm of the Fae in The Rose Red Bride. In this short story, a friends-to-lovers story, Padraig rescues Rosamunde, his valor making her realize that she loves him, too. III. The True Love Brides At the end of The Snow White Bride, Alexander decrees that his remaining sisters will marry for love. The portal to the realm of the Fae has been opened, though, and the Fae king Finvarra desires Elizabeth. Finvarra agrees that he will abandon his suit if four of the siblings marry their true loves, although Elizabeth knows that the portal to the Fae realm has to be closed as well. 1. The Renegade’s Heart Isabella is smitten with a rogue knight, come to Kinfairlie to demand the return of his family’s stolen treasure. She takes Murdoch’s cause against that of her brother, then learns that Murdoch has been claimed by the Fae queen - who holds his heart still. Can a mortal maiden defeat an immortal queen by winning Murdoch’s love for her own? 2. The Highlander’s Curse Garrett is cursed to hear the thoughts of others as clearly as his own, a spell intended to make him an outcast so his legacy could be stolen. He finds solace in the company and the touch of gentle Annelise. Can Annelise’s love heal him so he can recover his stolen legacy and give her the home - and the husband - she deserves? 3. The Frost Maiden’s Kiss Malcolm returns to Ravensmuir after years as a mercenary with a hoard large enough to finance the rebuilding of his legacy and his soul due to the Fae. When pregnant Catriona arrives at Ravensmuir, Malcolm knows he can give her a future with a marriage of convenience that makes her child heir to Ravensmuir. Catriona expects nothing of men, but Malcolm’s kindness and strength earns her love - and makes her determined to save his soul, regardless of the price. 4. The Warrior’s Prize The mercenary Rafael thinks his companion’s sister, Elizabeth, could be an angel come to earth, and one who will hold him accountable for his sins. Challenged by her and enticed by her, Rafael offers himself instead of his comrade Malcolm and begins to change his life with his choices. Can he save Elizabeth from Finvarra? He’s determined to try, no matter what the risk to himself - and Elizabeth cannot resist a man who chooses nobly, just for her. IV. The Brides of Inverfyre There is one sibling left unmarried (Ross) and we follow him to Inverfyre, where the children of the Hawk and Aileen also need to be married. 1. The Mercenary’s Bride This Scottish medieval romance is a Christmas novella, the story of a knight returning to Inverfyre to keep his promise to the laird’s daughter. Having been attacked and left for dead, Quentin is no longer the man he was and he blames the Hawk for the change in his fortunes. But his bitterness melts before the admiration of Mhairi, for the maiden he admired has become a beauty he would die to serve. 2. The Runaway Bride Even though Aiofe is a beauty and an heiress, she wants to marry for love. Her marriage is arranged to the oldest son of the Hawk of Inverfyre, but she chooses to flee instead, hoping that his cousin, Ross, will be sent after her. Aiofe intends to claim Ross’s heart, no matter the price, for she knows with one glimpse that he’s the man for her. Ross is caught between his duty and his heart - and the wicked MacLarens who would use Aiofe as a pawn in their own plan to possess Inverfyre. There will be more stories in this series, too.

Myths and Ancient Stories,['Kevin Mills'],2024-05-02,['Literary Criticism'],"An introduction to ancient myths and the critical discussions that surround them, this book dives into the stories of pre-modern culture, taking a comparative look at how they have shaped the West and modern storytelling as we have come to understand it today. It makes texts and scholarship from near Eastern, Classical and Celtic disciplines engaging and accessible, and traces narrative meaning through stories from ancient Mesopotamia to the BritishMedieval Period, offering compelling pathways into such writings as The Epic of Gilgamesh, Genesis and Job, The Odyssey, The Mabinogi, The Life of St Cadoc and Sir Orfeo. Looking at each in detail, Myths and Ancient Stories also explores myth through a modern lens, probing at how, in this scientific age, it continues to inspire contemporary film, games and literary works such as those by, Margaret Atwood, Colm Tóibín, Madeleine Miller and Pat Barker. Impressive in breadth and bringing together a wide range of foundational texts from diverse traditions for the first time, this work is the ideal orientation to the ancient works central to English literary culture, shedding light on the mythological roots of storytelling and narrative.",N/A,N/A
Mastering Fear,['Rikke Schubart'],2018-07-12,['Social Science'],"Mastering Fear analyzes horror as play and examines what functions horror has and why it is adaptive and beneficial for audiences. It takes a biocultural approach, and focusing on emotions, gender, and play, it argues we play with fiction horror. In horror we engage not only with the negative emotions of fear and disgust, but with a wide range of emotions, both positive and negative. The book lays out a new theory of horror and analyzes female protagonists in contemporary horror from child to teen, adult, middle age, and old age. Since the turn of the millennium, we have seen a new generation of female protagonists in horror. There are feisty teens in The Vampire Diaries (2009–2017), troubled mothers in The Babadook (2014), and struggling women in the New French extremity with Martyrs (2008) and Inside (2007). At the fuzzy edges of the genre are dramas like Pan's Labyrinth (2006) and Black Swan (2010), and middle-age women are now protagonists with Carol in The Walking Dead (2010–) and Jessica Lange's characters in American Horror Story (2011–). Horror is not just for men, but also for women, and not just for the young, but for audiences of all ages.",N/A,N/A

Their leader, concerned for their morale, dares to take them on a mission to confront the fullness of everything they've lost. Little does Drake realize that this dangerous mission will give him a renewed purpose. And if they succeed these Pyr will have to question everything they thought they knew about the past—and confront a quest for the future. *** This short story evolved out of an out-take from Whisper Kiss and features the Dragon's Tooth Warriors. Because I liked the original scenes, it grew into a short story in its own right. It has romantic elements but is not a romance in itself. I recommend reading it before Whisper Kiss. It is available on its own in this digital edition and is also included in Here Be Dragons: The Dragonfire Companion. *** The Dragonfire Series of Paranormal Romances Each Dragonfire Novel is a complete romance, but you would probably prefer to read them in order to follow the story of the Dragon's Tail Wars, the final battle for supremacy between the Pyr and the evil Slayers.

Maeve's Book of Beasts,['Deborah Cooke'],2019-08-05,['Fiction'],"Careful what you wish for... A mysterious book given to Sylvia by a handsome stranger plunges her into a hidden world, awakening her ability to see a paranormal realm and the Others who live in it. It also makes her a target for the Dark Fae who want the book back—and who will kill her to reclaim it. The stranger, Sebastian, becomes Sylvia's reluctant defender—but his ability to influence her dreams is almost as dangerous as the fact that he's a vampire. On the run with Sebastian, Sylvia learns about the plan of Maeve, Queen of the Dark Fae, to eliminate all other paranormal creatures. Possession of the book means that Sylvia is caught in the middle of a war between the Dark Fae and the Others, with a predator as her only ally. If she can decipher the book, will that help the Others to fight for their survival? Should she trust Sebastian? Or does the vampire who ignores all the rules have a secret plan of his own? *** The DragonFate Novels continue the story of Deborah's dragon shape shifting heroes called the Pyr. Each book is a romance in which a dragon shifter meets his destined mate—in DragonFate, those heroines have powers of their own. Maeve's Book of Beasts is a prequel to DragonFate that introduces both Maeve's evil plan to eliminate paranormal species from the world (including the Pyr) and the cast of characters assembling to defeat her. In it, you'll meet Sebastian, a vampire who has escaped Maeve and is building the team to destroy her, and Sylvia, the mortal librarian he chooses to hide the ancient volume stolen from Maeve. Sebastian gets more than he expects from Sylvia—never mind that Maeve wants her book back—and Sebastian's slow-burn romance with Sylvia will arc over the entire series. The other slow burn romance in this series features Mel, an immortal fae who needs to find true love to break the curse placed upon her. She's haunted by her late husband, Raymond, who betrayed her but wants to make it right. You can read Mel and Raymond's story, a romance that doesn't end happily and a retelling of a medieval French fairy tale, in Claire Delacroix's An Elegy for Melusine. The DragonFate series so far: 1. Maeve's Book of Beasts 2. Dragon's Kiss (dragon shifter Kristofer and Valkyrie Bree) 3. Dragon's Heart (dragon shifter Rhys and selkie Lila) 4.

Steaming into a Victorian Future,"['Julie Anne Taddeo', 'Cynthia J.

"Cataclysm, Books 1-4",['Ann Gimpel'],2021-02-14,['Fiction'],"Bundled together for the first time! Over 1200 pages of riveting vampiric urban fantasy. Harsh Line My very existence is under attack. I’ve kept a low profile, told myself the craziness sweeping the world would pass me by. Yeah, it was wishful thinking, actually an outright lie, but it’s kept me sane. I’ve been hiding out forever in one guise or another. Currently, I run a nightclub. Ascent is an “ask me no questions, and I’ll tell you no lies” haven. For everybody. I’m a Vampire. Far be it from me to judge. My closest ally is a shapeshifting dire wolf. I adopted him when he was a scrawny puppy, but I’m getting ahead of my tale. The fragile détente between supernaturals and humans has crashed and burned. I can’t avoid the truth any longer. Lucky for me, mortals don’t know exactly what I am. When I moved to Seattle, some vampiric sixth sense urged me to play my cards close to my vest, but I’m done burying my secrets. And my power. Warped Line I chose stasis—a long sleep—for me and two of mine. Hard to time these things, but we woke in the eye of a cyclone. When I went to sleep—to avoid being drained of magic and blood by dark Sorcerers—Vampires weren’t exactly on the endangered species list, but not many of us are left. No one ever accepted us. Not mortals and not others with power, either. At least one of those dams has developed a few cracks. Supernaturals aren’t quite welcoming, but they’ll take help from any quarter. Mortals have declared war on magic, and they won’t rest until we’re all sitting in iron-clad prisons. What a bunch of cowards. If they weren’t hiding behind false humanitarian walls, they’d be honest about their intentions and do their damnedest to kill us outright. Cracked Line Vampires don’t fall in love. Except I did. Not the best decision of my long life. I definitely cracked an unspoken line, but Ariana trounced me as far as line-crossing went. Very few acts constitute crimes in Vampire circles. Hers was the worst. I fled to the Old Country to buy myself thinking time. I still loved her, but what she’d done was so vile I couldn’t set it aside. We face huge problems, but I’m tackling them one by one. I’ll return to Ariana’s side, but perhaps only as her comrade-in-arms. Time will tell if we can be more to each other. Time and circumstances. In a world without magic, Vampires will wither along with every other magic-wielder. I cannot let that happen. Broken Line In all my years as a Vampire, hundreds of them, I never imagined humans would be anything other than food. Rich, pure, delectable blood. Prey that fought back never posed a problem. Mortals couldn’t stand against those of us with supernatural ability. That world still exists, but it’s taken a backseat to humans who’ve joined forces with turncoat mages. Mortals were never meant to wield power. Over the long haul, they’re sure to be very sorry for the choices they’ve made. Maybe someday I’ll be a humble innkeeper again, but it’s so far in the future I can’t even think about it. Nope. For now, all I see is blood. Rivers of it, and not running down my gullet, either. On the plus side, I have good friends, powerful allies, and a Vampire who loves me. We have to come through this unscathed. Have to. I’m Ariana Hawke, and I take care of what’s mine.",N/A,N/A
Tiana,['Ann Gimpel'],2022-11-01,['Fiction'],"I need more time to train Tiana, but our enemies won’t wait for the young Sidhe Queen to embrace her full power. At the drop of a hat—seemingly—I became a mother. Not that I’d ever considered the possibility of parenthood. If I had, whatever I came up with would have been far off the mark. Tiana had opinions before she was born. Ones she was vocal about. She inherited my affinity for animals, Blake’s wings, and his Sidhe royal lineage. In Underhill, they hail her as their queen, which has made raising her far more difficult. If one of us says no, she runs to her bevy of honorary aunts and uncles, one of whom is sure to indulge her. Between Tiana’s magic and her position in Sidhe society, I assumed she’d be a target from the moment of her birth. Somehow, a dozen years have passed. I’ve often let my guard down—and kicked myself for my lack of vigilance. Steeped in magic, my wild child gets lost in the moment. I need a few more years to entrain her power. But if I know that, so do our enemies. They will come for her. When it happens, we must be ready. All of us. Reader Note: If you enjoy urban fantasy with Celtic goddesses, unicorns, Sidhe, Cailleach, and a magical owl this story is for you. It’s the 5th book in the Wayward Mage series.

Just Like Starting Over,['Deborah Cooke'],2025-08-21,['Fiction'],"Once burned, twice shy. That’s how it’s supposed to work. I thought I’d learned my lesson after falling for Mike Cavendish in high school. Sixteen years ago, all my dreams were coming true, then everything went wrong in one disastrous night. It’s so much more than a broken heart and a loss of trust. It’s raising a daughter alone, abandoning your old life to make a new one, and being defined by your roles rather than your dreams. The only bright light is Sierra herself, a wise child who has taught me so much in her fifteen years. She is everything to me. It’s because of Sierra that we've come back to my hometown of Empire to help my bestie Merrie launch her dream, The Carpe Diem Café. I’m sick of avoiding the past and I miss my grandmother. Why have I let Mike take that away from me and from Sierra? I’m sure I’m over him by now. I don’t expect him to turn up, looking better than ever - much less acting as if he still cares, pretending he doesn’t know that Sierra is his, wanting to start all over again. It’s a proposition that I know I should refuse, but…it’s Mike. And he’s not the same guy I knew. Oh, he’s still quiet and thoughtful, but tougher, more direct – and a whole lot hotter. He can make all of Sierra’s dreams come true without even trying and when he decides to make me believe in forever again, I don’t think I can resist just one night. Can I trust Mike’s promises again? More importantly, can I take a chance and let myself fall head over heels again with the man who has always been my one and only?",N/A,N/A
"Chaucer and the Making of English Poetry, Volume 2",['P. M. Kean'],2019-09-23,['Literary Criticism'],"Originally published in 1972. This important work of Chaucerian scholarship deals with two aspects of the poet and his work - his individual achievement and his place in history - and demonstrates that in both these senses Chaucer is a maker of English poetry. The author explores Chaucer’s narrative art. The book includes an examination of the puzzling question of narrative structure in the Canterbury Tales and of the nature of Chaucerian comedy in these works. The author surveys the major themes of the poems: Fortune and free will, marriage, and the nobleness of man. In the final chapter she treats of the meaning of Chaucer’s art for his successors. Throughout the work, Miss Kean deals extensively with the sources which Chaucer used for the writing of his poems, in a way which directs light on the more difficult aspects of his art.",N/A,N/A

Imagining a mysterious natural catastrophe that plunges its people into a barbaric future, Jefferies remarkable novel drowns and destroys London and depicts a challenging aWild England dominated by nature and filled with evolved animals and devolved humans. Of its time but also distinctively modern, After London can, in its uneasy expression of Victorian and post-Victorian anxieties about industrial development, urbanisation, natural resources, and climate, be regarded as one of the first novels of the Anthropocene. This new critical edition provides one of the earliest examples of a global catastrophe novel that is part of a flowering of nineteenth-century science fiction. It situates After London in a tradition of mid-late Victorian texts that respond to the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace and responds to a host of other key social, political, and cultural issues of the period.Key FeaturesOpens up readings that situate the text in relation to a range of literary, cultural and biographical contexts including Jefferies life, ideas, and worksIncludes a chronology of Jefferies' life, a list of his key works, a detailed scholarly introduction, and appendices including the text of 'The Great Snow', a catastrophe short story set in London; and 'Alone in London'; both of which reveal his attitude to London, urban life and the future of humanity",N/A,N/A
Adventures in Amethyst A Trio of Holiday Romances,['Karen Wiesner'],2022-09-26,['Fiction'],"(3 in 1 volume) including: Halloween: NEVER A BRIDE, Book 11: Once upon a time, Ben Johnson believed he had forever sewn up with Layla. But fairy tales rarely come true in reality. Long before her nephew was in a hunting accident and she blamed Ben for not preventing it, the two of them had broken up, citing irreconcilable differences. Layla hadn't wanted his family to know the truth. Following the accident, she walked out--for good, he assumed. Charlize Seagrave never fit in anywhere, drawn to danger, darkness, and drugs. For years, she was the guitarist and songwriter for a death-metal band and involved with the frontman who only encouraged her deadly addictions. In order to hide from Freyr, Charlize checked herself rehab. Later, clean--another first in her life--she attended her new friend's wedding and met Ben. Despite their instant connection, he was supposedly in a committed relationship and she had no interest whatsoever in commitment. If only Ben wasn't so unlike every other person she's ever known. If only she didn't feel like he alone understands and gets her. When Charlize returns to Amethyst at Halloween, Ben knows loneliness has nothing to do with his feelings for her. His attraction to her the last time she was in Amethyst wasn't something he was comfortable with, despite that he and Layla had broken up even before his family learned of the fact. But now Layla is implying she's had a change of heart. Ben wonders if this is all getting too complicated...or if the solution is as simple as a kiss. Thanksgiving: UNLUCKY IN LOVE, Book 12: Layla Dupriest's father was killed in a hunting accident when she was a child so, when the man who was once the love of her life, Benji Johnson, encourages her nephew to go hunting and he's hurt, she blames Ben. Months later, she can see she wasn't fair. Adam Schaefer has loved Tally Johnson, Benji's sister, since he was a teenager, but his love of flying and freedom surpassed anything that might clip his wings like a wife, monogamy, marriage, and settling down. The last thing he expected was for her to fall for his best friend--and to have that man's baby. Unlucky in love and unable to count their blessings during the Thanksgiving holiday, Layla and Adam find themselves jilted at the same time. Heartbroken, snowed in, and forced to share the only available cabin in town, they have no choice but to re-evaluate everything they've ever wanted in life...and love. Christmas: SHOTGUN WEDDING, Book 13: Trevor and Eden were married right out of high school. She'd believed she was pregnant, but that hadn't been her sole motivation. Wildly in love with Trevor Johnson, she'd worried he was becoming disenchanted with her, his attention consumed by the needy and seductive Delaney Foster who came to Amethyst every year with her family. In the years Eden and Trever have been married, she's never felt quite secure in the belief that he married her by choice, in love. During the Christmas season, plagued by unspoken guilt and doubts, she finds herself again competing with a soon-to-be divorced, distraught, and disgustingly gorgeous Delaney. Eden is obsessively aware she's no longer as young, thin, or sexy as she'd been before she had three sons. To top off her growing stress, Eden has discovered she and Trevor's oldest son and his girlfriend, in their senior year of high school, are sexually active. The last thing they need is another shotgun wedding and the potential that a marriage undertaken for the sake of a baby isn't necessarily one of choice or love.",N/A,N/A

The money he made allowed him to date debutants and to sleep with divorced women who knew the score. Did he want to find real love one day? Sure, he wanted a wife. Eventually.

Until the right woman came along, the Honorable Doris Isette Pearson looked like a perfect distraction. She had handled her own divorce and was now on the dating market. Among the members of the Falls Church Country Club, Doris was nearly as infamous as him. The woman also played a mean game of golf and he’d heard stories about her almost going pro. Her tendency to buck convention as much as Harrison did definitely made Doris worthy of a tumble. She wasn’t his first older woman so the decade difference in their ages didn’t bother him a bit. After all, it wasn’t like he was going to marry the woman. All he wanted was to share her lonely divorcee bed and maybe stir things up at the club with a few mixed-gender golf games.

The Real History of Tom Jones,['J. Stevenson'],2015-12-05,['Literary Criticism'],"The Real History of Tom Jones revivifies historical materials from which Henry Fielding constructed the greatest comic novel of the eighteenth century. This study recovers and explores the contexts necessary to understand Fielding's subtle art, such as the bloody conflict for the throne between Stuarts and Hanoverians, a contradictory class system, game laws that both protected and flouted individual property rights, and a justice system that proclaimed hanging for many crimes but let most criminals go. Drawing on evidence such as the peculiar appearance of eighteenth-century money, the fraudulent autobiography of a gypsy king, and a magical prayer book illustration, the book offers new readings of both Tom Jones and the political and legal landscape of Georgian England.",N/A,N/A

John Neal and Nineteenth-Century American Literature and Culture,"['Edward Watts', 'David J. Carlson']",2012-02-01,['Literary Criticism'],"John Neal and Nineteenth-Century American Literature and Culture critically reassesses the significance of American novelist, editor, critic, and activist John Neal to the transatlantic literary culture of the nineteenth century. Long appreciated primarily as a powerful advocate of literary nationalism in the United States, Neal is presented in this volume as an innovative literary stylist, a penetrating cultural critic, a pioneering regionalist, and a vital participant in the business of letters in America over a sixty-year career. The volume’s contributors (including scholars from the United States, Germany, England, Italy, and Israel) employ a wide range of critical methodologies (legal studies, psychoanalysis, cultural studies, etc.) to survey Neal’s career from his early novel writing in the 1820s to his culminating autobiography, published in 1869. Special attention is paid to his work as an editor, journalist, critic, and publisher in a variety of journals. Throughout this discussion, Neal emerges as a vastly underappreciated artist and a figure of considerable importance to the ongoing reassessment of the American Renaissance and the broader cultural history of the nineteenth century. The editors’ introduction (and the volume as a whole) offers an overview of the present vitality of the new Neal scholarship while also suggesting a number of areas for future research and inquiry.",N/A,N/A

As the Oak Creek Claus, I've spent years spreading Christmas cheer in my small town. But this holiday season, there's more than snow clouding my view. From skunk attacks to accounting chaos to my sister-in-law's high-risk pregnancy, I'm juggling more ornaments than our town square Christmas tree. And then there's Opal Whittaker, Oak Creek’s new midwife, who's spicier than gingerbread and all I want to find under my tree. But Opal's got more walls than Santa's workshop, and she seems to think I'm just a holiday fling. I'm on a mission to win Opal's heart and show her that Oak Creek—and my arms—is where she belongs. This year, Santa's got a new Christmas wish, and I'm calling in every favor to make it come true. With a sack full of humor, a town full of nosy neighbors, and enough Christmas spirit to light up the North Pole, I'm determined to make this a holiday we'll never forget.",N/A,N/A

Breaking the Alien Love Curse,['Veronica Scott'],2024-03-12,['Fiction'],"Amellia Taneek loved her job as the office manager for a group of Sectors agents from various organizations, all based out of her central location. She enjoyed the challenges of handling administrative details for them and the excitement of constantly meeting new offworlders. She was especially intrigued by Hagan Raljarr, seven feet of green, scaled, muscular SCIA agent, and more than a little curious about his tail. Hey, she was a healthy unmarried, unattached female and there was no rule against dating a co-worker. But so far he’d shown confusing signs of reciprocating her interest. Hagan was an honorable warrior and before he could pursue his definite interest in Amellia, who might even be his fated mate, he had to clear up one little detail – the engagement contract he’d been entered into as a child with a female from his own planet. They barely knew each other and she was highly ambitious. Surely in this modern day and age she’d be happy for him to sever the contract and set her free, right? Leaving him in the perfect position to begin courting the lovely human. But the jilted fiancée sends a mysterious box across the galaxy to him and when he unwisely opens it, a powerful love curse is activated, striking both him and Amellia. They’ll die at dawn if the curse isn’t broken. With help from Amellia’s aunt, who is said to have magic powers, the pair set out on a desperate quest for three special ingredients needed to break the spell. Over the course of a very long night, will Hagan and Amellia find their way to a relationship, break the curse in time and survive? Is such a thing even possible?

The Modern Gothic and Literary Doubles,['L. Dryden'],2003-09-01,['Literary Criticism'],"The Modern Gothic and Literary Doubles is concerned with Gothic representations of London in the late 19th century.

Books in Motion,['Mireia Aragay'],2005,['Literary Criticism'],"Books in Motion addresses the hybrid, interstitial field of film adaptation. The introductory essay integrates a retrospective survey of the development of adaptation studies with a forceful argument about their centrality to any history of culture--any discussion, that is, of the transformation and transmission of texts and meanings in and across cultures. The thirteen especially composed essays that follow, organised into four sections headed 'Paradoxes of Fidelity', 'Authors, Auteurs, Adaptation', 'Contexts, Intertexts, Adaptation' and 'Beyond Adaptation', variously illustrate that claim by problematising the notion of fidelity, highlighting the role played by adaptation in relation to changing concepts of authorship and auteurism, exploring the extent to which the intelligibility of film adaptations is dependent on contextual and intertextual factors, and making a claim for the need to transcend any narrowly-defined concept of adaptation in the study of adaptation. Discussion ranges from adaptations of established classics like A Tale of Two Cities, Frankenstein, Henry V, Le temps retrouvé, Mansfield Park, Pride and Prejudice, 'The Dead' or Wuthering Heights, to contemporary (popular) texts/films like Bridget Jones's Diary, Fools, The Governess, High Fidelity, The Hours, The Orchid Thief/Adaptation, the work of Doris Dörrie, the first Harry Potter novel/film, or the adaptations made by Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Walt Disney.

Winterson Narrating Time and Space,"['Mine Özyurt Kılıç', 'Margaret J-M Sönmez']",2009-05-27,['Fiction'],"In this book, scholars, students and aficionados of Jeanette Winterson will find ten analyses of time, space and narrative in her works. From her very first novel, Jeanette Winterson has made her characters move in time and in space, and she has always shown a sophisticated interest in narrative forms, and this is the first book to focus entirely on these central concerns. The writers of the essays provide different perspectives on the three subjects, from postmodernism to quantum physics, queer theory to genre studies and the uncanny to stylistics. In its section on time and narrative, the volume offers a fresh approach to Winterson's works, with a concentration on autobiographical elements, love, desire, the language of quantum physics, and the queer uncanny. The next section, space and narrative, pursues the motifs of journeys, utopic spaces, cyberspace and labyrinths, and includes a chapter on the shorter fiction. The last section, which comprises essays that cover all three elements of time, space and narrative equally, examines these themes as they affect Winterson's representation of voices and corporeality, and her use of romance narrative in the children's fiction. The volume covers Winterson's major fiction, with the Introduction connecting the images of huts, rivers and fire-gazing that are found extensively in her works to the themes of time and space, and bringing the discussion up to Winterson's latest novel, The Stone Gods. A mixture of established and new scholars presents in this book an exciting array of the latest ideas on this respected and popular writer.",N/A,N/A
Angels at the Eastport Bridge,['MacIntyre'],2011-09-15,['Fiction'],"Though it may seem a bit complicated, the story is simple, and when all the pieces are laid out, it is plain to see where it all began. It started with one single human by the name of Tane MacGregor; one single, officially insane, homeless dust rag of a man. He occasionally caught glances from passing strangers as he swung his feet rhythmically from the drawbridge over the calm waters of Spa Creek, and he was often found in the company of angels. As it was said, MacGregor was seen as the glue, the string binding all the events and beings which created a rather remarkable occurrence in the soft, beautifully adjacent, scenic towns of Annapolis and Eastport and, in particular, about the small Eastport Drawbridge over Spa Creek, spanning and dividing the two. Now, as the story would be told and retold in most homes and taverns around the Chesapeake for many years, it was too easily called coincidence. True, it began at a certain time with a certain person, in a certain situation, accompanied by an incredible series of events, people, celestial beings, lawyers, homeless schizophrenics, ghosts, God, junk food, and small deviations in time and space, with waving definitions of good and evil, all coming together in a perfect harmonic mix but coincidence?",N/A,N/A

As We Are and As We May Be,['Sir Walter Besant'],2020-09-28,['Fiction'],"Those who begin to consider the subject of the working woman discover presently that there is a vast field of inquiry lying quite within their reach, without any trouble of going into slums or inquiring of sweaters. This is the field occupied by the gentlewoman who works for a livelihood. She is not always, perhaps, gentle in quite the old sense, but she is gentle in that new and better sense which means culture, education, and refinement. There are now thousands of these working gentlewomen, and the number is daily increasing. A few among them—a very few—are working happily and successfully; some are working contentedly, others with murmuring and discontent at the hardness of the work and the poorness of the pay. Others, again, are always trying, and for the most part vainly, to get work—any kind of work—which will bring in money—any small sum of money. This is a dreadful spectacle, to any who have eyes to see, of gentlewomen struggling, snatching, importuning, begging for work. No one knows, who has not looked into the field, how crowded it is, and how sad a sight it presents. For my own part I think it is a shame that a lady should ever have to stand in the labour market for hire like a milkmaid at a statute fair. I think that the rush of women into the labour market is a most lamentable thing. Labour, and especially labour which is without organization or union, has to wage an incessant battle—always getting beaten—against greed and injustice: the natural enemy of labour is the employer, especially the impecunious employer; in the struggle women always get worsted. Again, in whatever trade or calling they attempt, the great majority of women are hopelessly incompetent. As in the lower occupations, so in the higher, the greatest obstacle to success is incompetence. How should gentlewomen be anything but incompetent? They have not been taught anything special, they have not been 'put through the mill'; mostly, they are fit only for those employments which require the single quality that everybody can claim—general intelligence. Hopeless indeed is the position of that woman who brings into the intellectual labour market nothing but general intelligence. She is exactly like the labourer who knows no trade, and has nothing but his strong frame and his pair of hands. To that man falls the hardest work and the smallest wage. To the woman with general intelligence is assigned the lowest drudgery of intellectual labour. And yet there are so many clamouring for this, or for anything. A few months ago a certain weekly magazine stated that I, the writer, had started an Association for Providing Ladies with Copying Work—all in capitals. The number of letters which came to me by every post in consequence of that statement was incredible. The writers implored me to give them a share of that copying work; they told terrible, heart-rending stories of suffering. Of course, there was no such Association. There is, now that typewriting is fairly established, no copying work left to speak of. Even now the letters have not quite ceased to arrive.",N/A,N/A

Five Middle English Arthurian Romances,['Valerie Krishna'],2014-08-13,['Literary Criticism'],"The poems in this collection will give the reader an appreciation of both the distinctiveness and the variety of the medieval English Arthurian tradition and highlight some of this important chapter in Arthurian legend literature. The Middle English stories are different in style and structure to the later French romances, composed in poetic forms that derive from native English traditions. The Stanzaic Morte Arthur is the earliest version of the Lancelot-Guinevere story in English; The Awyntas off Arthure at the Terne Wathelyn is a serious moral poem while the story of the Avowing is a tail-rhyme romance. The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell is a strongly folkloric variation of Chaucer’s Wife of Bath’s Tale and Syre Gawene and the Carle of Carlyle is an alternative version of the testing of Gawain. Originally published in 1991, the translator gives an introduction to each poem as well as a general introduction about the development of the Arthurian poetic tradition.",N/A,N/A

'A heart-warming, funny and poignant story about the joys and heartbreaks of country living. A winner.'

Visit us online at www.1stWorldLibrary.ORG - - In John Lyly's Endymion, Sir Topas is made to say; ""Dost thou know what a Poet is? Why, fool, a Poet is as much as one should say, - a Poet!"" And thou, reader, dost thou know what a hero is? Why, a hero is as much as one should say, - a hero! Some romance-writers, however, say much more than this. Nay, the old Lombard, Matteo Maria Bojardo, set all the church-bells in Scandiano ringing, merely because he had found a name for one of his heroes. Here, also, shall church-bells be rung, but more solemnly. The setting of a great hope is like the setting of the sun. The brightness of our life is gone. Shadows of evening fall around us, and the world seems but a dim reflection, - itself a broader shadow. We look forward into the coming, lonely night. The soul withdraws into itself. Then stars arise, and the night is holy. Paul Flemming had experienced this, though still young. The friend of his youth was dead. The bough had broken ""under the burden of the unripe fruit."" And when, after a season, he looked up again from the blindness of his sorrow, all things seemed unreal. Like the man, whose sight had been restored by miracle, he beheld men, as trees, walking. His household gods were broken. He had no home. His sympathies cried aloud from his desolate soul, and there came no answer from the busy, turbulent world around him. He did not willingly give way to grief. He struggled to be cheerful, - to be strong. But he could no longer look into the familiarfaces of his friends. He could no longer live alone, where he had lived with her. He went abroad, that the sea might be between him and the grave. Alas! Between him and his sorrow there could be no sea, but that of time.",N/A,N/A

The Professor and the Profession,['Robert Bechtold Heilman'],1999,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Robert Bechtold Heilman is one of the last survivors of a remarkable generation of American critics that included such literary giants as Cleanth Brooks, Allen Tate, and Edmund Wilson, men to whom literary criticism was not a profession or an academic necessity but a calling. In a distinguished career that has spanned nearly six decades, Heilman has influenced generations of scholars and critics through his exquisitely written commentaries on subjects ranging from William Shakespeare to Thomas Hardy. In The Professor and the Profession, Heilman looks back over his life and times from his perspective as both an academic and an American. Differing in theme and subject matter, the essays included in this collection are ultimately unified by the author himself. Whether the topic is football, Robert Penn Warren, or education, Heilman's generous and intelligent voice emerges on every page. Yet this collection is more than one academic's personal reminiscences; it is a reflection upon American literary history itself. In the first section of essays, ""The Self Displayed,"" Heilman reveals how he developed from a small-town boy into a distinguished critic and teacher, touching upon his participation in baseball and love of football along the way. ""Writers Portrayed"" and ""Literary Types and Problems Inspected,"" the following sections, offer his opinions on the past and on the current state of American literary criticism, including personal portraits of such renowned friends as Eric Voegelin, Robert Penn Warren, Theodore Roethke, and Malcolm Cowley. The final section, ""Education Examined,"" is an enlightening inquiry into the development of American universities in the twentieth century. A fascinating chronicle of a significant academic life, The Professor and the Profession will appeal to a broad array of scholars, from young academics wanting to know where they came from to those of Heilman's generation who can appreciate this personal reminiscence into the world of letters.",N/A,N/A

Well, I am unwise; I always was unwise, and this has paid in a coin not always recognised, but precious to a man's spiritual pride. Why should I not criticise my contemporaries? It is not a merit to be a contemporary.

The Complete Lover,['Angelica Goodden'],1989,['Fiction'],"Sentiment and sentimental education are central themes in French novels of the 18th century. However, what do these fictions really say about the art and practice of love? What part should the emotions--or the intellect--play in sexual relationships? Will the lover find fulfillment in sophisticated urban society, or in the natural world? Is a man's approach different from a woman's? This study looks at these questions and tracks the pursuit of eros through such works as Crébillon's Les Egarements du coeur et de l'esprit, Prévost's Manon Lescaut, Rousseau's La Nouvelle Héloïse, Diderot's La Religieuse, and Laclos's Les Liaisons Dangereuses. Goodden considers the interplay between love and friendship, the portrayal of beauty, and the rhetoric of passion, to show that the dual character of the 18th century is reflected in the lover who becomes complete by allowing reason to guide sentiment.",N/A,N/A

Not more than sixteen. John couldn't have left him. She wasn't certain. She was no nearer certainty so long as she didn't know when the boy had died. If only she knew- They hadn't unfastened his tunic and shirt to feel over his heart if he were dead. So he couldn't have been dead when they left him.... But there was Sutton. Billy wouldn't have left him unless he had been dead. Her mind worked rapidly, jumping from point to point, trying to find some endurable resting place.... He was so young, so small, so light. Light. It wouldn't take two to carry him. She could have picked him up and carried him herself. Billy had had the lame man to look after. He had left the boy to John. She saw John looking back over his shoulder. She got up and went through the house, through all the rooms, to see if there were any more of them that John had left there. She felt tired out and weak, sick with her belief, her fear of what John had done. The dead boy was alone in the house. She covered his face with her handkerchief and went back. The Belgian waited for her at the entrance to the yard. He had dragged himself there, crawling on his hands and knees. He smiled when he saw her. ""I was coming to look for you, Mademoiselle."" She had him safe beside her against the stable wall. He let his head rest on her shoulder now, glad of the protecting contact. She tried not to think about John. Something closed down between them. Black. Black; shutting him off, closing her heart against him, leaving her heart hard and sick. The light went slowly out of the street, out of the sky. The dark came, the dark sounding with the ""Boom-Boom"" of the guns, lit with spiked diamond flashes like falling stars.
