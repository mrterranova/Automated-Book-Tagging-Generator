Alessia and Matteo broke me and rebuilt me in shadows."" — Reader Review My name is Matteo Moretti, and I do my best work in silence. I'm the strategist, the ghost, the man behind the blood-soaked curtain. No one sees me coming—especially not my new wife, Alessia Falcone. She was meant to be forgettable. Soft. Simple.

She thinks she's walking beside a monster. She's right. But what neither of us saw coming is this: she's the only one who could bring me to my knees. And in the end, love might not save us. It might destroy us both.

Three high school friends are able to do two things no one else on the planet can do . . . talk with dead people and time travel to the past. For Kelly, it’s a major adjustment to move from the only life she has ever known in Texas to live with her aunt in Ft. Myers Beach, Florida. She quickly makes friends with her quirky next door neighbor, Scott and his best friend, Austin. In her aunt’s garage, they find a long-lost invention of Thomas Edison called “The Telephone to the Dead”. Edison had abandoned the project and given it to Kelly’s great-great-grandfather. Scott tinkers with it until they can hear sounds coming from it. But instead of broadcasting music . . . it picks up conversations from the dead. As they slowly turn the dial they hear hundreds of sad, lonely voices of souls that have passed but apparently never moved on, pleading for help. A teenager’s voice separates from the rest and begs for their help to clear her reputation. They are shocked to find out that she had gone to their own high school . . . 47 years ago. They research the girl’s story and discover that her name was Wendy and she had been a popular cheerleader who had apparently committed suicide. The teens are touched by Wendy’s cries and pleas, but they have no way to go back in time to help her. That is, until Scott reveals an nvention of his own . . . a time travel app. Kelly and Austin are very skeptical. Even Scott isn’t sure it will work, so they try it out on his sister’s pet turtle. Amazingly, the turtle disappears. But did it travel to the past or just wander off? Finally, they decide to humor Scott and go along with his claims of time travel. They meet on the beach after everyone else has gone home. They stand in the formation Scott insists will create the perfect vortex for time travel. At the last moment, a fourth person runs forward and is pulled into their adventure back to 1966. They figure out a way to get close to Wendy without her asking too many questions that they can’t answer. But as they discover the secret to her death, they find it’s not as clear-cut as it would seem. A romance gone wrong, an over-attentive teacher and a young girl’s dreams for the future are all twisted into a mystery that causes the teens to take greater risks than they could have imagined. It all becomes very real when their own lives are in danger and they realize they may never make it back to the present. OMG – Winner of the Best Indie Book of 2013 for Young Adults and Finalist in the 2013 Beverly Hills Book Awards. Well plotted and fast paced.

The O'Ruddy A Romance,['Stephen Crane'],2025-03-27,['Fiction'],"The O'Ruddy: A Romance by Stephen Crane is a captivating narrative that captures the essence of love, adventure, and the often tumultuous interplay of personal ambition and societal expectations. Set against the backdrop of the late 19th century, this novel combines elements of romance, humor, and social commentary, showcasing Crane's masterful storytelling and keen observation of human character. Through a tale marked by spirited dialogue and vivid imagery, Crane invites readers into a world where passion and intrigue intertwine, inviting both laughter and reflection. The story follows the life of the protagonist, *Peter O’Ruddy*, an American who arrives in London with grand aspirations of becoming a successful writer and making his mark in the world. However, it quickly becomes evident that life does not conform to our visions of success and glamour. Instead, O'Ruddy's journey is full of unexpected twists and turns, illuminating the struggles that accompany the pursuit of dreams. This theme resonates deeply with readers, as it reflects the universal quest for identity and fulfillment. Crane skillfully illustrates how societal norms and personal ambitions can clash, forcing individuals to navigate not only external hurdles but also their inner desires. At the heart of the narrative lies a passionate romance that develops between O'Ruddy and the enchanting *Lady Connie*. Their relationship serves as a lens through which Crane explores themes of love, maturity, and the sacrifices individuals make for those they cherish. O’Ruddy's infatuation with Lady Connie is palpable, revealing the intoxicating qualities of young love while also highlighting its complexities. The way Crane crafts their connection provides depth to the story, shifting the focus from a simple romantic subplot to a more profound exploration of relational dynamics in a world that often prioritizes status over emotion. As O'Ruddy grapples with his feelings for Lady Connie, he also faces pressures from the upper echelons of society, represented by characters who embody aristocracy and privilege. Crane’s portrayal of the British upper class is both satirical and insightful, revealing the absurdities and pretensions that accompany wealth and status. O’Ruddy, often depicted as a man of the people, finds himself navigating the complexities of social class, which fosters a rich commentary on the nature of identity and societal acceptance. Crane's keen observations serve to challenge readers' perspectives on class distinctions and the inherent value of individuals regardless of their social standing. The novel is punctuated by Crane's trademark prose style, characterized by sharp wit and vivid imagery that brings scenes to life. His descriptions are not merely decorative; they enhance the understanding of his characters’ emotions and motivations. The clever dialogue crackles with humor and insight, making each interaction between characters engaging and memorable. This stylistic choice contributes to the overall buoyancy of the narrative, allowing readers to become fully immersed in the world Crane has created. Crane also employs irony throughout the novel to emphasize the discrepancy between expectations and reality. O'Ruddy’s romantic aspirations often collide with the harsh truths of life, leading to moments of both comedy and poignant self-reflection. This interplay creates a nuanced exploration of the human experience, as it mirrors the ups and downs of love and ambition that many individuals face. Crane's deft handling of irony elevates the narrative, making it not just a love story, but a deeper examination of the intricacies of human emotions and desires. The setting of the novel further anchors the story in a vibrant historical context. Crane effectively uses London as a backdrop, capturing its bustling streets, grand estates, and the distinct cultural milieu of the time. The city acts almost as a character in its own right, influencing the lives of O'Ruddy and Lady Connie. This detail enriches the narrative, offering readers a sense of place that is both tangible and evocative. As O'Ruddy navigates the challenges of his romance and aspirations within this dynamic environment, the backdrop serves to heighten the stakes of his journey. Ultimately, *The O'Ruddy* is a tale of resilience—of a man striving to reconcile his dreams with the realities of love and societal expectations. Through O'Ruddy’s experiences, Crane reflects on the nature of ambition, the transformative power of love, and the importance of embracing both triumphs and failures as integral parts of the human experience. The novel encourages readers to question conventional definitions of success and fulfillment, prompting a reevaluation of one’s desires in the pursuit of happiness. In doing so, Crane’s work transcends its time, inviting modern audiences to engage with its themes of love, identity, and the quest for meaning in an often-chaotic world. In conclusion, *The O'Ruddy: A Romance* stands as a unique contribution to the literary canon, showcasing Stephen Crane's ability to weave humor, social critique, and profound emotional depth into a singular narrative. Its exploration of the complexities of love, ambition, and societal expectations remains remarkably resonant, encouraging readers to reflect on their own aspirations and relationships. This novel invites us not only to enjoy a delightful romance but also to engage with the deeper questions of what it means to dream, love, and inhabit a world full of contradictions.",N/A,N/A,en

First published in 1910, this novel serves as a sequel to Ollivant's earlier work, *The Romance of Sussex*, and delves deep into the lives of its characters as they navigate the trials and tribulations of love, class, and social expectations in a rapidly changing world. Ollivant, known for his keen observations and insightful characterizations, masterfully crafts a narrative that intertwines the lives of its protagonists with the rich and evocative landscape of Sussex. The story centers on characters whose interactions reveal the nuances of romantic entanglements and the often unpredictable nature of love. At its heart, *One Woman* is a testament to the idea that love can be both a source of joy and anguish, serving as a poignant reminder of the intricacies of the human heart. The novel follows the life of the protagonist, John Wreight, who finds himself entangled in a complex relationship with the captivating and enigmatic woman, Maud. Maud embodies the tensions between tradition and modernity, as she represents both the societal expectations placed on women and the burgeoning desire for independence and self-definition in the early 20th century. Through John’s eyes, readers are invited to witness the evolution of their relationship, marked by moments of passion, misunderstanding, and emotional turmoil. Ollivant’s nuanced portrayal of Maud highlights the struggles faced by women during this period, evoking empathy and reflection on the societal constraints that shape their lives.

The tension between individual desires and societal expectations is a recurring motif throughout the novel. As Maud grapples with her identity and place within a patriarchal society, her struggle becomes emblematic of broader issues faced by women during the early 20th century. Ollivant’s exploration of this theme resonates with readers even today, inviting contemplation on the evolving roles of women and the ongoing quest for autonomy and self-fulfillment. At its core, *One Woman* is not just a story of romantic love but also an exploration of the concept of female agency. As Maud navigates her relationship with John and the societal pressures that surround her, the novel raises important questions about the nature of love, commitment, and personal freedom. Ollivant’s sensitive portrayal of these themes prompts readers to consider the complexities of emotional bonds and the sacrifices individuals make for love. The narrative structure of the novel is engaging, with compelling dialogue and emotional depth that bring the characters to life. Ollivant’s writing showcases an impressive balance between storytelling and lyrical prose, drawing readers into the emotional landscape of the characters’ experiences.

A gentleman searching for a purpose in life sets out to claim his legacy, only to discover that instead of the country residence he’d expected, he’s inherited an eccentric community whose enterprises are overseen by a decidedly determined young lady who is disinclined to hand over the reins. Gregory Cynster arrives at the property willed to him by his great-aunt with the intention of converting Bellamy Hall into a quiet, comfortable, gentleman’s country residence, only to discover the Hall overrun by an eclectic collection of residents engaged in a host of business endeavors under the stewardship of a lady far too young to be managing such reins. With the other residents of the estate, Caitlin Fergusson has been planning just how to deal with the new owner, but coming face to face with Gregory Cynster throws her and everyone else off their stride. They’d anticipated a bored and disinterested gentleman who, once they’d revealed the income generated by the Hall’s community, would be content to leave them undisturbed. Instead, while Gregory appears the epitome of the London rake they’d expected him to be, they quickly learn he’s determined to embrace Bellamy Hall and all its works and claim ownership of the estate. While the other residents adjust their thinking, the burden of dealing daily with Gregory falls primarily on Caitlin’s slender shoulders, yet as he doggedly carves out a place for himself, Caitlin’s position as chatelaine-cum-steward seems set to grow redundant. But Caitlin has her own reasons for clinging to the refuge her position at Bellamy Hall represents. What follows is a dance of revelations, both of others and also of themselves, for Gregory, Caitlin, and the residents of Bellamy Hall.

I enjoyed every moment... A delicious slice of golden escapism.' – Louise Douglas, bestselling author of The House by the Sea One bizarre to-do list to earn her inheritance. One Spanish summer. One huge family secret. Juliana makes a modest living as an 'ethnic' TV/film extra – even though the only connections with her Spanish heritage are her cacti, Spanish classes, and some confused memories of a Spanish mother she hasn't seen since she was seven. When her beloved Uncle Arturo offers her the chance to discover her roots while housesitting his coastal home in a quiet corner of Andalusia, Juliana can't believe her luck. Especially when he reveals that the house will be hers if she fulfils ten life-enhancing 'Conditions' within 90 days. Redecoration of the house and a visit to the old film studio where her mother used to sew costumes seem ridiculously simple tasks for such a wonderful reward. But little does Juliana realise that there are family secrets and inherited rivalries awaiting her in sunny Spain, and the condition that she has to 'get on with the neighbours' – who include a ruggedly handsome but moody artist – may be harder than she thinks.

Maksim (Nederlands),['Nicole Cypher'],2025-01-23,['Fiction'],"Geniet van deze enemies-to-lovers gevangen maffiaromance van dark romance-auteur Nicole Cypher… Ik wilde een echtgenote zijn. In plaats daarvan maakten ze me een hoer. Ontworteld, duizenden kilometers en een oceaan verwijderd van mijn thuis, kwam ik naar Amerika om bij mijn verloofde te zijn, maar het universum—en de Petrov Bratva—hadden andere plannen. In plaats van een spreekwoordelijke koets die me naar mijn prins op het witte paard bracht, werd ik bij aankomst geconfronteerd met een geladen pistool en in een vrachtwagen gegooid, vol met ongelukkige zielen met verhalen zoals het mijne. En nu, alsof het niet erger kan, word ik niet verkocht. Ik word cadeau gedaan aan een Bratva-luitenant die me niet eens wil. Een man walgelijker dan wie ik ooit heb gekend. Een leugenaar. Een manipulator. Een arrogante, tactloze narcist die te egoïstisch is om ooit om iemand anders te geven dan zichzelf. Ik haat hem. Verafschuw hem. Maar wat gebeurt er als de omstandigheden veranderen, het gevaar op de loer ligt en ik hem nodig heb? Een opmerking van Nicole: Perfect voor fans van Natasha Knight, Nicole Fox en Sophie Lark. Maksim is boek één in de op zichzelf staande maffiaromanceserie de Petrov Maffia. Het is een donkere, enemies-to-lovers, gevangen maffiaromance die sommigen misschien aanstootgevend vinden.

For Gillies, sure enough, and as you say, the first one I ever knew of his getting. There he is, making up the northern mail. You'd better hand it over.

"The Romance of the Milky Way, and Other Studies & Stories",['Lafcadio Hearn'],2022-09-16,['Fiction'],"In ""The Romance of the Milky Way, and Other Studies & Stories,"" Lafcadio Hearn intertwines the realms of folklore, mythology, and personal narrative, capturing the ephemeral beauty of the human experience as viewed through a prism of natural wonder and cultural depth. His literary style reflects a lyrical elegance, employing vivid imagery and evocative language that mirror the themes of dreams and the supernatural. Grounded in both Eastern and Western traditions, Hearn's work resonates with the essence of late 19th-century literary explorations into spirituality and the mystical, presenting readers with a multifaceted mosaic of human belief and imagination. Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904), a Greek-born writer who spent significant time in Japan, was profoundly influenced by his intercultural encounters and his embrace of diverse philosophical narratives. His experiences as an immigrant and his fascination with Japan's aesthetics and customs inevitably led him to explore themes of identity and transience, which permeate this collection. Hearn's journey through life, marked by shifts in geography and culture, fueled his quest to understand universal truths, making his stories resonate across time and space. This collection is highly recommended for readers seeking to delve into the interplay of culture and narrative.

Gabrielle of the Lagoon,['A. Safroni-Middleton'],2015-07-09,['Fiction'],"Excerpt from Gabrielle of the Lagoon: A Romance of the South Seas Though it was night and there was no moon, a dim, wierd light lay over the isle and pierced to the depths of the forests. It was in the Solomons, where the dark, picturesque surroundings of palm and reef, the noise of the distant surfs, made a suitable setting for anything unexpected. Even the silver sea-birds had weird, startled-looking eyes down Felisi beach way. And when the wild brown men crept away from the grave-side of one whom they had just buried in the forest, the winds sighed a fitting music across the primeval heights. But there was nothing strange in that; men must die wherever one goes, and it was a common enough occurrence in that heathen land where the ocean boomed on the one side and inland to the south-west stood the mountains, looking like mighty monuments erected in memory of the first dark ages. Across the skies of Bougainville the stars had been marshalled in the millions. It seemed a veritable heathen faeryland as the night echoed a hollow ""Tarabab!"" But even that heathenish word was only the tribal chief's yell as he stood under the palms conducting the semi-religious tambu ceremony. The tawny maidens and high chiefs, with their feather head-dresses, all in full festival costume, were squatting in front of the secret tambu stage, some mumbling prayer, others beating their hands together as an accompaniment.
