I stand in awe of anyone who can piece together the puzzle of a man's life so fully, especially a man as odd and contradictory as Herrmann. A brilliant job.""—Leonard Maltin ""Bernard Herrmann was a master of psychology. His incredibly innovative music ‘inhabited’ the film it was in, creating moods that stayed with the audience long after the film was over. Steven Smith captures the very heart of what Herrmann represented. I highly recommend this book to anyone who truly wants a glimpse into the world of this musical giant who changed the very nature of film composing.""—Esa-Pekka Salonen, music director, Los Angeles Philharmonic ""Fascinating.

Spain,['Andrew Whittaker'],2008,['Foreign Language Study'],"* Provides a deeper, long-term understanding of the nation and its people * Designed to supplement the ""usual suspect"" guide books A guidebook can show you where to go, a phrasebook what to say when you get there. Only Speak the Culture: Spain will lead you to the nation's soul. Spain boasts a rich and sometimes misunderstood culture, itself infused with the influences of other great and distant civilizations. Spanish life, language and culture in its widest sense is a major force of growing influence. How many outside it understand its origins and significance? Through exploring the people, the movements and the lifestyles that have shaped the Spanish experience, you will come to an intimate understanding of Spain and the Spanish. There are many travel guides and manuals on living in Spain. Speak the Culture: Spain is different: a superbly designed, informed and entertaining insight into Spanish life and culture and who the Spanish really are. For new residents, business travelers, holidaymakers, students and lovers of Spain everywhere, Speak the Culture: Spain is an engaging companion and guide to an enviably rich civilization at the heart of Europe. Excerpt ""As you might expect Spain's traditional vernacular architecture isn't easily pigeonholed; regionalism generates marked variation. Available building materials and, more significantly, climate have always dictated how people build their houses or outbuildings. The Spaniards' approach to living arrangements is more easily summed up. They're nothing if not sociable; while northern Europeans anxiously section off their own plot of terra firma, in Spain they seem to enjoy living on top of each other, clustered in apartments and houses around the plaza mayor. It's not like they're short of space either--a population density of around 85 per sq km is one of the lowest in Europe.""",5,N/A,en

Excerpt ""It would be wrong to imagine that your average Frenchwoman just pops into Chanel on the Rue du Faubourg-St-Honoré whenever she needs a new bag, cardy or fragrance. While a significant minority do indulge in ready-to-wear lines produced by designer labels, most are happy with less brand-conscious garments. Small boutiques and historic department stores like Le Bon Marché and Les Galeries Lafayette sell the big brands, but many French are happy to buy anonymous clothes at knockdown prices in chain stores like Tati, or even in the hypermarket.""",2,N/A,en

Hong Kong Babylon,"['Fredric Dannen', 'Barry Long']",1997,['Motion picture actors and actresses'],"Over the past few years, Hong Kong movies have become more popular and studied by critics and film-goers alike.

Conversely, Hong Kong film-makers like John Woo have crossed over and put their unique stamp on American films like Hard Target and Broken Arrow with John Travolta. In his book Fredric Dannen depicts the dark inner world of Hong Kong cinema: the brave and enigmatic actors who risk their lives performing dangerous stunts and explosive feats of martial arts; the movie producers, many of whom are involved with the criminal triad families and who will resort, literally, to murder to secure a deal or an actor for a film.

Digital Compositing for Film and Video,['Steve Wright'],2002,['Art'],"Digital Compositing for Film and Video is a hands-on, practical, how-to guide that addresses the problems and difficult choices faced by the professional compositor in real-life situations. It presents techniques, tricks, and solutions for dealing with badly shot elements, coloration artifacts, and mismatched lighting that bedevil actual compositors working on real shots. Readers are offered in-depth practical methods for matte extraction, despill procedures, compositing operations, and color correction--the ""meat and potatoes"" of all digital effects. Compositing is the artistic blending of several disparate elements from a variety of sources into a single image while making all the component elements appear to be in the same light space and shot with the same camera. When confronted with a bad composite any observer will recognize that something is wrong--the artist will know what is causing the problem, and the technician will know how to fix it. A good compositor must be both an artist and a technician. Written by a senior compositor with over ten years' experience in both feature film and broadcast television, this book offers a broad range of alternative solutions that will save hours of fiddling with composites trying to get them to look right when the basic tools aren't working. A companion CD-ROM provides examples of the many topics covered in this book.",N/A,N/A,en

Filming Pancho,['Margarita de Orellana'],2009,['Mexico'],"On January 3, 1914, Pancho Villa became Hollywood's first Mexican superstar. In signing an exclusive movie contract, Villa agreed to keep other film companies from his battlefield, to fight in daylight wherever possible, and to reconstruct battles if the footage needed reshooting. Through memoir and newspaper reports, Margarita De Orellana looks at the documentary film-makers who went down to cover events in Mexico. Feature film-makers in Hollywood portrayed the border as the dividing line between order and chaos, in the process developing a series of lasting Mexican stereotypes-the greaser, the bandit, the beautiful señorita, the exotic Aztec. Filming Pancho reveals how Mexico was constructed in the American imagination and how movies reinforced and justified both American expansionism and racial and social prejudice.",N/A,N/A,en
Transcultural Montage,"['Christian Suhr', 'Rane Willerslev']",2013,['Art'],"The disruptive power of montage has often been regarded as a threat to scholarly representations of the social world. This volume asserts the opposite: that the destabilization of commonsense perception is the very precondition for transcending social and cultural categories. The contributors—anthropologists, filmmakers, photographers, and curators—explore the use of montage as a heuristic tool for comparative analysis in anthropological writing, film, and exhibition making. Exploring phenomena such as human perception, memory, visuality, ritual, time, and globalization, they apply montage to restructure our basic understanding of social reality. Furthermore, as George E. Marcus suggests in the afterword, the power of montage that this volume exposes lies in its ability to open the very “combustion chamber” of social theory by juxtaposing one's claims to knowledge with the path undertaken to arrive at those claims.",N/A,N/A,en

The Place of the Audience,"['Mark Jancovich', 'Lucy Faire', 'Sarah Stubbings']",2003-04-28,['Drama'],"It has been a recurring complaint both within and against film studies that it has largely ignored the activities of audiences. This book aims to address this absence (as compared to television studies) and to explain its cause. The authors argue that there is a social context in which the consumption of film can be understood or studied historically; demonstrating that a concentration on the place of film consumption within the changing cultural politics of the city can offer a compelling and productive focus of analysis. This book examines not only the different meanings of different sites of film exhibition and distribution (city-centre cinemas, local cinemas, art-house cinemas, multiplexes, terrestrial television transmission, video rental and retail, and satellite/cable), but also the meanings of the activities of film consumption associated with these sites. Through use of archival materials and ethnographic studies of the audience, the book examines the meanings of film consumption from the earliest film showings up to the 21st century.",N/A,N/A,en

Music and Levels of Narration in Film,['Guido Heldt'],2013,['Music'],"Music and Levels of Narration in Film is the first book-length study to synthesize scholarly contributions toward a narrative theory of film music. Moving beyond the distinction between diegetic and nondiegetic music--or music that is not understood as part of a film's ""story world""--Guido Heldt systematically discusses music at different levels of narration, from the extrafictional to ""focalizations"" of subjectivity. Heldt then applies this conceptual toolkit to study the narrative strategies of music in individual films, as well as genres, including musicals and horror films.

Reel Gender,"[""Sa'ed Atshan"", 'Katharina Galor']",2022-11-17,['History'],"Reel Gender, co-edited by Palestinian scholar Sa'ed Atshan and Israeli scholar Katharina Galor, provides a groundbreaking opportunity to bring together chapters that address the social realities and the filmic representations of Palestine and Israel. Although numerous overlapping themes and inquiries within Palestinian and Israeli film explore and portray gender-related questions, scholars have largely continued to focus on either Palestinian or Israeli repertoires separately. The eight essays of Reel Gender, by leading scholars in their respective fields, demonstrate how Palestinian and Israeli film production-despite obvious overlaps and similarities and while keeping in mind the inherent asymmetry of power dynamics-are at the forefront of engaging gender and sexuality. At the same time, the scholars remain mindful that comparisons and similarities need to be anchored with cognizance of structural asymmetries at the levels of production, reception, and general political-social contexts. They construct and deconstruct still and moving images, characters, and stories that together create an entanglement of Palestinian and Israeli fiction and reality. Together they portray the region's diverse but unexpectedly intermingled ethnic, religious, and national communities, framed or countered by various societal norms, laws, and expectations, and defined by geopolitical boundaries, while drawing methodologically from the fields of Media and Cultural Studies, Critical and Postcolonial Theory, Feminism, Post-feminism, and Queer Theory.",N/A,N/A,en
Garbo,['John Bainbridge'],1975,['Biography & Autobiography'],"There is only one Garbo, and this is her only definitive biography. Acclaimed by the critics-and a best seller- in its original version, it has now been brought up to the present, and beautifully illustrated with one hundred thirty-two memorable photographs. The result: an even more fascinating study of one of the screen's true immortals. In a period spanning less than two decades, from 1925 to 1941, this shy, working-class girl from Stockholm, the possessor of the face of the century, made twenty-four films, and became the most famous actress in the world. She also became one of its great ornaments and excitements and objects of wonder-""the unapproachable goddess,"" said Alistair Cooke, ""of the most widespread and remarkable mythology in human history."" As a consequence, she found herself the victim of more fatuous and hysterical journalism than any other personality on earth. Mercilessly hounded by the public and press at every turn, she developed an intense aversion to publicity that contributed to making the world's most beautiful woman into one of its loneliest. ""I never said, 'I want to be alone, '"" Garbo told a friend. ""I only said, 'I want to be let alone.' There is all the difference."" With sensitivity, wit, and understanding, Mr Bainbridge presents the whole fabulous story from its unlikely beginning through her last picture and into her retirement, which, ironically, Garbo never planned to make permanent. Her life today-her friends, her interests, her haunts-brings this absorbing biography up to the present moment.

The Film Paintings of David Lynch,['Allister Mactaggart'],2010,['Art'],"One of the most distinguished filmmakers working today, David Lynch is a director whose vision of cinema is firmly rooted in fine art. He was motivated to make his first film as a student because he wanted a painting that ""would really be able to move."" Most existing studies of Lynch, however, fail to engage fully with the complexities of his films' relationship to other art forms. The Film Paintings of David Lynch fills this void, arguing that Lynch's cinematic output needs to be considered within a broad range of cultural references. Aiming at both Lynch fans and film studies specialists, Allister Mactaggart addresses Lynch's films from the perspective of the relationship between commercial film, avant-garde art, and cultural theory. Individual Lynch films--The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, The Straight Story, Mulholland Drive, Inland Empire--are discussed in relation to other films and directors, illustrating that the solitary, or seemingly isolated, experience of film is itself socially, culturally, and politically important. The Film Paintings of David Lynch offers a unique perspective on an influential director, weaving together a range of theoretical approaches to Lynch's films to make exciting new connections among film theory, art history, psychoanalysis, and cinema.",N/A,N/A,en

Led by filmmakers as influential as Truffaut and Godard, the New Wave was a seminal moment in cinematic history, and The New Wave has been hailed as the most complete book ever written about it. The New Wave tells the story of the New Wave through examinations of five of the most important directors of the era: Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer, and Rivette. With detailed notes and over fifty breathtaking stills, the book has appealed both to academics and interested novices alike. The thirtieth anniversary edition includes a new afterword by the author. Praise for the first edition of The New Wave: “The most complete book I know on the five most important directors of the New Wave.” - Costa-Gavras “At last a book that intelligently and critically examines that remarkable phenomenon known as the New Wave. Not just a book for film buffs, it is essential reading for anyone interested in the interrelations between art, politics, and life in the second half of the twentieth century. A remarkable achievement.” - Richard Roud, Founder, New York Film Festival “There is a genuine kind of honesty at work in the writing: a sense that the author wishes to describe the subject more clearly, help the reader, and not ‘explain’ (in the pompous sense of the word) or criticize for the sake of being superior. It’s refreshing.” - Ted Perry, Museum of Modern Art",5,N/A,en

Moving beyond the oft-discussed perceptual elements of vision and hearing, The Multisensory Film Experience analyzes temperature, pain, and balance in order to argue that it is the experience of film that's inherently multisensory, not the medium. Luis Rocha Antunes here explores the work of well-loved filmmakers Erik Jensen, Gus Van Sant, and Ki-Duk Kim to offer new insights into how viewers experience films and understand their stories. This is an original contribution to an emerging field of research and will become essential reading for film scholars.",N/A,N/A,en

Seventies British Cinema,['Robert Shail'],2008-12-15,['History'],"Seventies British Cinema provides a comprehensive re-evaluation of British film in the 1970s. The decade has long been written off in critical discussions as a 'doldrums' period in British cinema, perhaps because the industry, facing near economic collapse, turned to 'unacceptable' low culture genres such as sexploitation comedies or extreme horror. The contributors to this new collection argue that 1970s cinema is ripe for reappraisal: giving serious critical attention to populist genre films, they also consider the development of a British art cinema in the work of Derek Jarman and Peter Greenaway, and the beginnings of an independent sector fostered by the BFI Production Board and producers like Don Boyd. A host of highly individual directors managed to produce interesting and cinematically innovative work against the odds, from Nicolas Roeg to Ken Russell to Mike Hodges. As well as providing a historical and cinematic context for understanding Seventies cinema, the volume also features chapters addressing Hammer horror, the Carry On films, Bond films of the Roger Moore period, Jubilee and other films that responded to Punk rock; heritage cinema and case studies of key seventies films such as The Wicker Man and Straw Dogs. In all, the book provides the final missing piece in the rediscovery of British cinema's complex and protean history.

How do plots and film practices represent children's subjectivity and agency? Childhood studies has demonstrated the importance of examining the lives of children. Building on those insights, together with current research from film studies and Latin American cultural studies, the essays in this volume analyze the development of agency and voices of minors in contemporary Latin American film. The theoretical perspectives used--gender studies, psychoanalytic and postcolonial theory, film studies, play and performance studies, and emotion studies, among others--take into account innovative approaches to filmic techniques as they explore the varied representations of children.",N/A,N/A,en

The filmmakers and critics talk about their own development, films which influenced their work, and the continuing controversies and alternative approaches in filmmaking. They take on their critics and their own previous positions with a clarity and forcefulness to be expected from some of the leading practitioners of their art. The interviews are introduced with a foreword by Roger Ebert, television commentator and critic for the Chicago Sun-Times. Mr. Ebert discusses the relation of art and politics and some of the common perspectives which unite filmmakers of different cultures and of diverse artistic and political temperaments. Among the subjects of these wide-ranging talks are: the choice between popular and experimental forms of narrative; the filmmaker's responsibility to society; blacks and women in the movies; the rise of third world filmmaking; Hollywood's left and progressives; the conditions of filmmaking in different societies; the challenges of independent production; different forms of censorship, from the U.S. to Poland; trends in criticism and auteur theory to feminism; the power of the reviewer.",N/A,N/A,en

He employs common sense words like balance, coherence, significance, and satisfaction to develop his insightful support of the subtle approach and of the unobtrusive director. Readers will learn why a scene from the humbler movie ""Carmen Jones"" is a deeper realization of filmmaking than the bravura lion sequence in the classic ""Battleship Potemkin."" Along the way Perkins invites readers to re-experience with clarity, directness, and simplicity other famous scenes by directors like Hitchcock, Eisenstein, and Chaplin. Perkins examines the origins of movies and embraces their use of both realism and magic, their ability to record as well as to create. In the process he seeks to discover the synthesis between these opposing elements. With the delight of the fan and the perception of the critic, Perkins advances a film theory, based on the work of Bazin and other early film theorists, that is rich with suggestion for debate and further pursuit. Sit beside Perkins as he reacquaints you with cinema, heightens your awareness, deepens your pleasure, and increases your return every time you invest in a movie ticket.",N/A,N/A,en

A History of Artists' Film and Video in Britain,['David Curtis'],2007,['Art'],"In recent years the use of film and video by British artists has come to widespread public attention. Jeremy Deller, Douglas Gordon, Steve McQueen and Gillian Wearing all won the Turner Prize (in 2004, 1996, 1999 and 1997 respectively) for work made on video. This fin-de-siecle explosion of activity represents the culmination of a long history of work by less well-known artists and experimental film-makers. Ever since the invention of film in the 1890s, artists have been attracted to the possibilities of working with moving images, whether in pursuit of visual poetry, the exploration of the art form's technical challenges, the hope of political impact, or the desire to re-invigorate such time-honoured subjects as portraiture and landscape. Their work represents an alternative history to that of commercial cinema in Britain - a tradition that has been only intermittently written about until now. This major new book is the first comprehensive history of artists' film and video in Britain. Structured in two parts ('Institutions' and 'Artists and Movements'), it considers the work of some 300 artists, including Kenneth Macpherson, Basil Wright, Len Lye, Humphrey Jennings, Margaret Tait, Jeff Keen, Carolee Schneemann, Yoko Ono, Malcolm Le Grice, Peter Gidal, William Raban, Chris Welsby, David Hall, Tamara Krikorian, Sally Potter, Guy Sherwin, Lis Rhodes, Derek Jarman, David Larcher, Steve Dwoskin, James Scott, Peter Wollen and Laura Mulvey, Peter Greenaway, Patrick Keiller, John Smith, Andrew Stones, Jaki Irvine, Tracy Emin, Dryden Goodwin, and Stephanie Smith and Ed Stewart. Written by the leading authority in the field, A History of Artists' Film and Video in Britain, 1897-2004 brings to light the range and diversity of British artists' work in these mediums as well as the artist-run organisations that have supported the art-form's development. In so doing it greatly enlarges the scope of any understanding of 'British cinema' and demonstrates the crucial importance of the moving image to British art history.",N/A,N/A,en

In a compelling blend of social science and humanities approaches, the authors use quantitative methods, as well as the voices of scriptwriters, directors, actors, and actresses, dozens of illustrative frame-grabs, and numerous case examples to answer core questions such as: Are we guilty of over-neglecting social factors in suicide prevention and research? Do cinematic portrayals distort or accurately reflect the nature of suicide in the real world? Has film presentation of suicide changed over 110 years? What are the literary roots of cinema portrayals? This unique book makes fascinating reading for all concerned with suicide prevention, as well as areas such as sociology, film and media studies, and mass communication.",N/A,N/A,en

Screening the Male,"['Steven Cohan', 'Ina Rae Hark']",1993,['Performing Arts'],"Screening the male re-examines the problematic status of masculinity both in Hollywood cinema and feminist film theory. Classical Hollywood cinema has been theoretically established as a vast pleasure machine, manufacturing an idealized viewer through its phallocentric ideological apparatus. Feminist criticism has shown how difficult it is for the female viewer to resist becoming implicated in this representational system. But the theroies have overlooked the significance of the problem itself - of the masuline motivation at the core of the system. The essays here explore those male characters, spectators, and performers who occupy positions conventionally encoded as ""feminine"" in Hollywood narrative and questions just how secure that orthodox male position is. Screening the Male brings together an impressive group of both established and emerging scholars from Britain, the United States and Australia unified by a concern with issues that film theorists have exclusively inked to the femninie and not the masculne: spectacle, masochism, passivity, masquerade and, most of all, the body as it signifies gendered, racial, class and generatonal differences.",5,N/A,en

British Tv & Film Culture in the 1950s,['Su Holmes'],2005,['Performing Arts'],"This book focuses on the emerging historical relations between British television and film culture in the 1950s. Drawing upon archival research, it does this by exploring the development of the early cinema programme on television - principally Current Release (BBC, 1952-3), Picture Parade (BBC, 1956) and Film Fanfare (ABC, 1956-7) - and argues that it was these texts which played the central role in the developing relations between the media. Particularly when it comes to Britain, the early co-existence of television and cinema has been seen as hostile and antagonistic, but in situating these programmes within the contexts of their institutional production, aesthetic construction and reception, the book aims to 'reconstruct' television's coverage of the cinema as crucial to the fabric of British film and television culture at the time. It demonstrates how the roles of cinema and television - as media industries and cultural forms, but crucially as sites of screen entertainment - effectively came together at this time in such a way that is unique to this decade.",N/A,N/A,en

Derek Jarman's Angelic Conversations,['Jim Ellis'],2009,['Performing Arts'],"Best known as an iconoclastic, wildly inventive filmmaker, Derek Jarman was also an accomplished author, painter, and landscape artist. In Derek Jarman's Angelic Conversations, Jim Ellis considers Jarman's wide-ranging oeuvre to present a broad perspective on the career and life of one of the most provocative, engaged, and important artists of the twentieth century. Derek Jarman's Angelic Conversations analyzes Jarman's work-including his famous films Caravaggio, Jubilee, Edward II, Blue, and Sebastiane-in relation to his critiques of the government and his activism in the gay community, from the liberationist movement to the AIDS epidemic. While others have frequently focused on Jarman's biography, Ellis looks at how his politics and aesthetics are intertwined to comprehend his most radical aspects, particularly in films such as War Requiem and The Last of England. Here Jarman is revealed as an artist who keenly understood the role of history and mythology in creating a personal and national identity: as an activist, he sought to challenge old histories while producing new ones to carve out a space for alternative communities in Britain late in the twentieth century.",N/A,N/A,en

The Multi-mediatized Other,[],2017-12-15,[],"During the period of the 1940s to the 1970s, the number of media and their influence were continually expanding. New media-film technology and television-developed and started to occupy people's everyday lives. A history of visual media shows that early on images took the form of drawings, paintings, sculptures, caricatures, and posters and then expanded through photography, press, cinema, television. Images were experienced rarely, at first, later were more often published in newspapers, journals, leaflets, and posters to become an everyday consumption in the form of the television. Initially, broadcasting took only a few hours in the evening and on one channel only ; later it expanded to all day programming on multiple channels. Television replaced other sources of information, offering the public more and more news from the world. This fact has lead us to the pivotal question of what creates the experienced reality and how ? How was the everyday human experience shaped, and what was the role of the visual media in it ? In order to find answers to these questions, we have to look at the characteristics of the particular kinds of visual media.",N/A,N/A,en

Cultural Transfer and Political Conflicts,"['Andreas Kötzing', 'Caroline Moine', 'Bill Martin']",2017,['Bundesrepublik'],"Film festivals during the Cold War were fraught with the political and social tensions that dominated the world at the time. While film was becoming an increasingly powerful medium, the European festivals in particular established themselves as showcases for filmmakers and their perceptions of reality. At the same time, their prestigious, international character attracted the interest of states and private players. The history of these festivals thus sheds light not only on the films they made available to various publics, but on the cultural policies and political processes that informed their operations. Presenting new research by an international group of younger scholars, Cultural Transfer and Political Conflicts critically investigates postwar history in the context of film festivals reconstructing not only their social background and international dispensation, but also their centrality for cultural transfers between the East, the West and the South during the Cold War.",N/A,N/A,en

Approaching girlhood, media, and methodology broadly, Mediated Girlhoods includes studies of such previously unexplored topics as girls' mimetic communication via Tumblr, the girlyboy in independent Filipino cinema, Qatari girls' film production, trans girlhood in advertising, Canadian girls' feminist activism, and the new girl subject imagined in Disney's Cinderella (2015). Mediated Girlhoods, Volume 2 is appropriate for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses, particularly graduate seminars exploring girlhood, media, and culture; youth media; youth cultures; and gender and media; and undergraduate courses housed within the following departments: media studies, communication studies, cultural studies, women's and gender studies, sociology, literature, history, education, and psychology.",N/A,N/A,en

Nach-Wende-Narrationen,"['Gerhard Jens Lüdeker', 'Dominik Orth']",2010,['History'],"English summary: What are the themes of the post-revolutionary era and how are they staged in literature and cinema? This volume provides an academic analysis and interpretation from literature and film of the narrative development of historical processes using the post-revolutionary period of reunified Germany as an example. Post-reunification narratives are understood to direct their focus on the period after reunification and do not narratively reflect on the period before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Post-reunification narratives are to be understood as documents of history and look forward to future events. They document the fraction of identities, both personal and collectively, that changed during reunification from a clearly defined Yesterday to an elusive Today. Although these stories attempt to provide positive imagery around the fall of the wall and on reunification, they actually show mostly an experience of loss, which sees its starting point during this historic event and remains far from over.

Nach-Wende-Narrationen sind als Dokumente der Erinnerung und der Gegenwartswahrnehmung zu verstehen. Sie dokumentieren gleichzeitig den Bruch von Identitaten, sowohl personal wie kollektiv, die durch die Wende aus einem klar definierten Gestern in ein schwer bestimmbares Heute gewechselt sind. Wenngleich in diesen Erzahlungen versucht wird, Mauerfall und Wiedervereinigung mit einer kollektiven, positiven Symbolik zu versehen, zeigen sie mehrheitlich eine Verlusterfahrung, die von diesem historischen Punkt ihren Ausgang nimmt und die noch langst nicht uberwunden ist.",N/A,N/A,de

Familiengeheimnisse,['Dagmar von Hoff'],2003,['History'],"In einer Zeit, in der sich Familienverbande auflosen und die Konstellation Vater-Mutter-Kind als ein kontinuierlicher Lebenszusammenhang nicht mehr selbstverstandlich ist, kann sich das Thema Inzest in einer erstaunlichen Weise behaupten. Denn die Familie mit ihren Geheimnissen, Verirrungen und Bekenntnissen spielt erneut eine grosse Rolle in Literatur und Film. Das Inzestthema ist nicht nur als skandaltrachtiges Motiv prasent, sondern auch als ein erzahlerisches Modell fur sprachliche und visuelle Strategien der Tabuisierung und Mythisierung. Die Autorin entwickelt einen neuartigen Zugang zur Literaturgeschichte nach 1945, indem sie sich der Inzestthematik philosophisch, ethnologisch und literaturwissenschaftlich nahert. Dabei fallt fur die deutschsprachige Literatur auf, dass inzestuose Familiengeschichten politische Diskurse verdecken, die nach 1945 auf das Trauma des Nationalsozialismus zuruckverweisen. Je nach Autor und Kontext wird Inzest zum Sinnbild fur Dekadenz und Schrecken, aber auch fur Schopfung und Hoffnung.",N/A,N/A,de
