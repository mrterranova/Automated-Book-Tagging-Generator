Physical Activity and Health,"['Claude Bouchard', 'Steven N. Blair', 'William L. Haskell']",2012,['Exercise'],"The human body is designed for activity. For most of our history, physical activity was required for survival, but technological advances have eliminated much of the need for hard physical labor. As our activity levels have dropped, it has become clear that a physically inactive lifestyle can lead to a host of health problems. Physical Activity and Health, Second Edition, provides a comprehensive treatment of the research on the benefits of a physically active lifestyle in comparison with the harmful consequences of physical inactivity. Written by leading scientists from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, Physical Activity and Health, Second Edition, brings together the results of the most important studies on the relationship between physical activity, sedentarism, and various health outcomes. The second edition has been fully updated based on the latest advances in this rapidly changing field and expanded to include the following new content: A chapter on the physiology of inactivity and the effects of sedentary behavior even in people who engage in appropriate amounts of physical activity, which is an area of growing interest; More extensive coverage of physical activity, aging, and the brain, including a new chapter on the relationship between physical activity and brain structures and functions; A chapter on the development of national and international physical activity and health guidelines, which will help readers better understand how scientific findings are converted into practical recommendations. Physical Activity and Health, Second Edition, offers a detailed yet concise presentation of key concepts as well as a framework to help readers relate results from single studies or collections of studies to the overall paradigm linking physical activity and physical fitness to health. For each of the topics covered, the text provides an overview of the most important research findings, discusses the limitations of the current knowledge base, and identifies directions for future investigation. At the core of the text is a review of our current understanding of how physical activity affects health concerns such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity as well as aging and mental health. The text identifies sedentary living habits and poor fitness as major public health problems and examines the potential of physical activity to prevent disease and enhance quality of life. This complete resource also looks at the evolution of the field of physical activity and health; variations in physical activity levels across age, sex, and ethnic groups; the body's physiological responses to physical activity; dose-response issues; and the influence of genetics on physical activity, fitness, and health. The book ends with an integration of the issues covered and discusses new opportunities for research. The second edition of Physical Activity and Health continues to offer clear, user-friendly coverage of the most important concepts and research in the field. Numerous special features will aid readers in their comprehension of the material. Chapter outlines and callout boxes help readers key in on important topics and focus their reading, and chapter summaries, definitions of key terms, and study questions provide tools for review and self-testing.

The Art of Resilience,['Ross Edgley'],2020-05-28,['Biography & Autobiography'],"'Incredible individual, incredible book, incredible story.' CHRIS HEMSWORTH 'A hero who is as humble as he is resilient... testament to a ""never give up"" spirit!' BEAR GRYLLS 'From reading this book, the message that comes shining through is this: you can achieve anything.' ANT MIDDLETON Bestselling author and award-winning adventurer Ross Edgley has been studying the art of resilience for years, applying all he has learned to become the first person in history to swim around Great Britain, breaking multiple world records. Now Ross focuses on mental strength, stoicism and the training needed to create an unbreakable body. Ross Edgley famously ran a marathon pulling a 1.4-tonne car and climbed a rope the height of Everest (8,848m), after living with Yamabushi warrior monks in Japan and partaking in Shamanic pain rituals with fire ants in the Amazon jungle. On his epic 1,780-mile journey around Great Britain, which lasted 157 days, Ross swam through giant jellyfish, arctic storms, 'haunted' whirlpools and polluted shipping lanes, going so hard, and so fast, his tongue fell apart. Ross's previous book, The World's Fittest Book, was a Sunday Times bestseller and explored the science of physical fitness. Now, in The Art of Resilience, Ross uses his swim experience and other amazing endurance feats, where he managed to overcome seemingly insurmountable pain, hardship and adversity, to study the performance of extreme athletes, military and fitness specialists and psychologists to uncover the secrets of mental fitness and explore the concept of resilience, persistence, valour and a disciplined mindset in overcoming adversity. This ground-breaking book represents a paradigm shift in what we thought the human body and mind were capable of and will give you a blueprint to become a tougher, more resilient and ultimately better human - whatever the challenge you face.",N/A,N/A,en

Find Your Path,['Carrie Underwood'],2020,['BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY'],"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER I want to be healthy and fit 52 weeks of the year, but that doesn't mean I have to be perfect every day. This philosophy is a year-round common-sense approach to health and fitness that involves doing your best most of the time--and by that I don't mean being naughty for three days and good for four. I mean doing your absolute best most of the time during every week, 52 weeks of the year.--Carrie Underwood Carrie Underwood believes that fitness is a lifelong journey. She wasn't born with the toned arms and strong legs that fans know her for. Like all of us, she has to work hard every day to look the way that she does! In FIND YOUR PATH she shares her secrets with readers, with the ultimate goal of being the strongest version of themselves, and looking as good as they feel. Carrie's book will share secrets for fitting diet and exercise into a packed routine--she's not only a multi-Platinum singer, she's a businesswoman and busy mom with two young children. Based on her own active lifestyle, diet, and workouts, FIND YOUR PATH is packed with meal plans, recipes, weekly workout programs, and guidelines for keeping a weekly food and workout journal. It also introduces readers to Carrie's signature Fit52 workout, which involves a deck of cards and exercises that can be done at home--and it sets her fans on a path to sustainable health and fitness for life. Fit52 begins with embracing the Pleasure Principle in eating, making healthy swaps in your favorite recipes, and embracing a long view approach to health--so that a cheat a day won't derail you. Throughout the book, Carrie shares her personal journey towards optimal health, from her passion for sports as a kid, to the pressure to look perfect and fit the mold as she launched her career after winning American Idol, to eventually discovering the importance of balance and the meaning of true health. For Carrie, being fit isn't about crash diets or a workout routine that you're going to dread. It's about healthy choices and simple meals that you can put together from the ingredients in your local grocery store, and making the time, every day, to move, to love your body, and to be the best version of yourself.",N/A,N/A,en

I truly have read every ""famous"" diet book published and I had settled into a low carb mentality. I would only eat certain fruits, certain veggies and almost no breads, rice or pastas (unless of course I wasn't ""ON"" my diet. This always left me feeling like I went ""OFF"" my diet.) After reading this well written survival guide for a healthy lifestyle my fridge looks like a rainbow and I have ditched the low carb mentality. Aprilanne Hurley has included so much valuable information and tips that this book serves me well as a reference book that I keep out on the counter. Included in the book are great recipes, exercise charts and tips, top 10 foods and why we should include them in our diet, and of course the 9 PRICELESS keys to good living. I printed a copy of that page and hung it by my desk. I especially like the PGD Overnight Makeover on page 123. This book explains WHY we should incorporate all this information into our healthy lifestyle which makes it more motivating to follow it. It is all backed up by the latest science available on the topic. I highly recommend this enjoyable gem of a book.""",N/A,N/A,en
