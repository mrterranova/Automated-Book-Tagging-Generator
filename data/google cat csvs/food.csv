Bread and Salt,"['R. E. F. Smith', 'David Christian']",1984,['Cooking'],"Bread and Salt - a literal translation of the Russian word for hospitality - explores the social and economic implications of eating and drinking in Russia in the thousand years before 1900. Eating and drinking are viewed here as social activities which involves the economics of production, storage and distribution of food stuffs. These activities attract both social controls and state taxation; in this way the everyday process of eating and drinking is linked with the history of Russia. The dominance of grain in the diet throughout the period and the importance of salt, as implied in the title, are dealt with, as are the early Russian beer-drinking fraternities. The relatively late introduction of spirits, in the from of vodka, and it disastrous consequences in social terms are described. Tea and the samovar, also much more a latecomer than is generally realized, did little to diminish excessive drinking. Drinking, in any event, was by no means discourage by the state, since it was a major source of state income. The final section of the book looks at rural diets in the nineteenth century, when some variation and new items, such as the potato, became important. At the same time, peasants depended basically on the grain crop, as they had for thousands of years. Forced by txation to enter the market, afflicted by severe famines towards the end of the century, many peasants ate and drank no better as a result of the modernization of the county.",N/A,N/A,en
Αθηναιου Ναυκρατιτου Δειπνοσοφιστων,['Athenaeus (of Naucratis.)'],1993,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"Athenaeus (AD ca. 170–ca. 230), a Greek of Naucratis in Egypt, lived in Rome and wrote a historical work now lost. Of the fifteen books of his surviving Deipnosophists ('Sophists at Dinner'), the first two and parts of the third, eleventh, and fifteenth exist only in summary, the rest apparently complete. In it he pretends to tell a friend about a banquet at a scholar's house whither the learned guests brought extracts from poetry for recitation and discussion. Much of the matter however concerns the food provided and accessories. One learns about cooks, strange dishes, wines, menu cards, and countless other matters. Athenaeus was an antiquarian. The whole work, which mentions nearly eight hundred writers and two thousand five hundred writings, is a large treasury of information not only about table matters but also music, dances, games, and all sorts of literary subjects. And it abounds in quotations, mostly made direct by Athenaeus himself, from authors whose writings have not survived. The Loeb Classical Library edition of The Deipnosophists is in seven volumes.

Terrors of the Table,['Walter Gratzer'],2005-09-29,['Health & Fitness'],"Terrors of the Table is an absorbing account of the struggle to find the necessary ingredients of a healthy diet, and the fads and quackery that have always waylaid the unwary and the foolish when it comes to the matter of food and health. Walter Gratzer tells the tale of nutrition's heroes, heroines and charlatans with characteristic crispness and verve. We find an array of colourful personalities, from the distinguished but quarrelsome Liebig, to the enterprising LydiaPinkham. But we also find the slow recognition that the lack of vital ingredients can cause terrible illnesses - scurvy, rickets, beriberi. These diseases stalked the poor in the West even into the 20th century, and scandalously remain in poorer parts of the world today. The narrative stretches from classicaltimes to the modern day and gives a valuable historical perspective to our current understanding. It also highlights some of the problems faced by the developed world regarding health today - in particular diabetes and obesity. And despite our far greater understanding of what our body needs, there are still many who would fall for fads and fancy diets - some dangerous, others just daft.Of course, the story of nutrition does not end there. We have discovered the key vitamins and minerals our body needs, but research continues on the connections between diet, health and disease. The body's biochemistry is complex, and there are no easy answers, no magic formula, that applies to all individuals. The safest and most rational course would seem to be a sensible, moderate, and varied diet, not forgetting that 'a little of what you fancy does you good'.",4,N/A,en

Food and Package Engineering,['Scott A. Morris'],2011-08-23,['Science'],"For the first time, engineering for the packaging industry – and for the biggest packaging user, food processing – is presented in a way that clearly demonstrates its interconnected, globally integrated nature. Food and Package Engineering is a groundbreaking work that serves as a comprehensive guide to the complexities and the potential of the industry. Packaging draws on nearly every aspect of science, technology, business, social science, and engineering. Rather than present a traditionally linear view of these topics, the author takes a ""Packaging Cycle"" approach by guiding readers through the life of the package from raw materials and conversion, operations, distribution, retail, all the way to recycling or disposal by the consumer. Food and Package Engineering includes many essential topics usually not addressed in other food engineering or packaging texts, including: Raw materials production and conversion Inventory management and production scheduling Regulations, security and food safety Recycling and landfill issues Transportation systems and distribution packaging Evaluation of developing technologies The comprehensive approach of this volume provides a framework to discuss critical interrelated topics such as economics, politics, and natural resources. Intended for readers with varying levels of experience, Food and Package Engineering provides multi-level accessibility to each topic, allowing both students and professionals to find useful information and develop technical expertise. Rather than being a simple exposition of technical knowledge, the book provides both real-world examples and challenging problems that require consideration at several different levels. Extensively illustrated and meticulously researched, Food and Package Engineering offers both a technical and a real-world perspective of the field. The text serves the student or industry professional at any level or background as an outstanding learning and reference work for their professional preparation and practice.",N/A,N/A,en

"The Culture of Food in England, 1200-1500",['C. M. Woolgar'],2016-01-01,['Cooking'],"In this revelatory work of social history, C. M. Woolgar shows that food in late-medieval England was far more complex, varied, and more culturally significant than we imagine today. Drawing on a vast range of sources, he charts how emerging technologies as well as an influx of new flavors and trends from abroad had an impact on eating habits across the social spectrum. From the pauper's bowl to elite tables, from early fad diets to the perceived moral superiority of certain foods, and from regional folk remedies to luxuries such as lampreys, Woolgar illuminates desire, necessity, daily rituals, and pleasure across four centuries.",N/A,N/A,en
"Friar Thomas D'Aquino: His Life, Thought, and Work",['James A. Weisheipl'],1974,['Biography & Autobiography'],"“The towering figure of Thomas Aquinas emerges with all his intellectual vitality in this definitive , up-to-date biography. Written by a leading scholar, and based on all the latest known facts of Aquinas’s life and works, its publication is a fitting commemoration of the seventh centennial of the death of Aquinas, one of the most influential thinkers of all ages.As comprehensive as it is readable, the book covers the man and his works as we know them today. The author develops the life of Aquinas in the social, political and cultural milieu of his age, eliminating many of the legends that have shrouded the man-legends that served more the needs of canonization than the needs of the true historian. Father Weisheipl stresses the close relationship between all the facets of Aquinas’s personality and his intellectual development, thus overcoming any tendency toward separating his “life” from his “thought”. The many movements and controversies in which Thomas was embroiled are drawn together with his doctrinal development, thus providing a lucid portrait of the whole man in the age in which he lived and worked.All in all, FRIAR THOMAS D’AQUINO is a major study on a major thinker, whose short life “fused the quiet of contemplation with the fever of activity.” A notable feature of this volume is the author’s attentive treatment throughout of the man and his environment as one. “A sound understanding of the man,” writes Weisheipl, “requires both an accurate grasp of his teaching and a thorough knowledge of the context in which he lived, moved, and had his being.” Included at the end of the text is a “Brief Catalogue of Authentic Works,” giving known place and time of composition together with the purposes and content of the work.”- Publisher",N/A,N/A,en

Food in Antiquity,"['Don R. Brothwell', 'Patricia Brothwell']",1969,['Cooking'],"A world-wide survey of the eating and drinking habits of early peoples, Don and Patricia Brothwell's ""Food in Antiquity"" covers a broad geographical range, from the early populations of Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Americas to the more familiar Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, and Roman worlds. From meat, insects, vegetables, and fruits to cooking oils and beverages, each source of sustenance is described in terms of who consumed it, how it was prepared, and how it spread from its region of origin. The Brothwells' treatment is engaging and the information they provide fascinating. We learn, for example, that the vinegar carried by Roman foot soldiers on long marches was mixed with water to serve as a refreshing drink and that fungi provided a reliable source of diet for peoples from Europe, Australia, Japan, and China. The authors consider such questions as whether St. John ate carob or actual locusts in his desert hermitage and whether ancient farmers may have rid their crops of troublesome pests by capturing and eating them. They discuss cannibalism, food taboos, and the radical changes that took place with the introduction of the domestication of animals.

"Tasting Food, Tasting Freedom",['Sidney Wilfred Mintz'],1996,['Health & Fitness'],"""Food is a central element of expression in all cultures. What and how we eat, and with whom, reveals much about our desires and relationships. In Tasting Food, Tasting Freedom, Sidney W. Mintz shows how our choices about food are shaped by a vast and increasingly complex global economy. Taking as examples everything from sugar's ascendance over honey as the most commonly used sweetener to the worldwide distribution of Coca-Cola, Mintz demonstrates how our consumption of a food can be shaped by a variety of external forces, including moral judgments and the demands of war."" ""Mintz goes on to argue that even under the most severe constraints, our choices can hold enormous significance for us. The title essay explores the way enslaved Africans' creative adaptation of their cuisine to New World conditions offered a symbolic hope of freedom. Other essays probe contemporary American eating habits: Why does the average weight of Americans keep increasing, even as dieting and healthy eating become more popular? Is there such a thing as an American cuisine? Should it matter to us?""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc. All Rights Reserved",N/A,N/A,en

Bringing the Food Economy Home,"['Helena Norberg-Hodge', 'Todd Merrifield', 'Steven Gorelick']",2002,['Business & Economics'],"There has been much discussion about the quality of food being provided by global agribusiness and the serious environmental impact it produces. The benefits of fostering a local food production are often dismissed, but it would address a range of health, social and environmental problems. The authors argue if the trend of large agribusiness were thought about rather than accepted without question, then local food production would be seen as a viable means of supplementing this existing system. They do not hesitate to suggest that the current system is unsustainable and does not provide real choice. Local food has a cultural context unique to where it is grown. The production of local food secures rural opportunities instead of forcing people to search for alternative livelihoods in urban areas. Local food production also eliminates many of the costs involved in transporting food across the country and around the world. This book presents a thoughtful argument that calls for a more conscientious and active role for people at the local level of food production.",N/A,N/A,en

The Hour of the Goddess,['Chitrita Banerji'],2001,['Cooking'],"Food and cuisine are not just incidental to Bengal; they are essential to the Bengali s mental and cultural landscape. Like in agricultural communities the world over, food and ritual, food and social custom, food and culture, are deeply imbricated. Women s lives are closely bound up with the production and preparation of food. This unusual book weaves a warm, evocative tapestry out of memories of food, ritual and women s lives in Bengal. In the skilful hands of the author, who writes of growing up from girlhood to womanhood in her native land, food and ritual become intimate experiences which definitively shape day-to-day life for the women of that culture. As memories of food preparation take shape, recalling associations of taste, smell and texture, a parallel thread of social commentary calls forth sharp observations; for example, how certain foods are forbidden and what Bengali widows cannot eat. Eminently readable, this volume combines rigorous research into food and cultural history, social critique, and the immediacy and intimacy of memoir. Chitrita Banerji grew up in Calcutta but now lives in Cambridge, Mass. She is the author of Life and Food in Bengal (London, 1991) and Bengali Cooking: Seasons and Festivals (London, 1997), as well as of numerous articles in The Boston Globe, Granta (London), Gastronomica (Berkeley), The Phoenix (Boston), Boston Magazine, Calyx (Corvallis, Oreg.), and Petits Propos Culinaires (London).

Sensory Evaluation of Food: Principles and Practices,"['Harry T.

It covers all the basic techniques of sensory testing, from simple discrimination tests to home use placements for consumers. It provides a practical guide to how tests are conducted and, for the reader who wishes a deeper understanding, provides the fundamental psychological and statistical theories that form the basis and rationale for sensory test design. Statistics used in sensory evaluation are demonstrated as integrated applications in the context of appropriate sensory methods and are also presented as a stand-alone material in appendixes. Statistical applications are tailored to common and relevance are obvious, and space is not wasted on designs or analyses that are not suitable for data collection from human observers. The text presents divergent philosophies in a balanced manner. Chapters are constructed so that beginning students who want only practical aspects of conducting sensory tests will find clear instructions on how tests should be conducted.

From Betty Crocker to Feminist Food Studies,[],2005,['Cooking'],"In recent years, scholars from a variety of disciplines have turned their attention to food to gain a better understanding of history, culture, economics, and society. The emerging field of food studies has yielded a great deal of useful research and a host of publications. Missing, however, has been a focused effort to use gender as an analytic tool. This stimulating collection of original essays addresses that oversight, investigating the important connections between food studies and women's studies. Applying the insights of feminist scholarship to the study of food, the thirteen essays in this volume are arranged under four headings--the marketplace, histories, representations, and resistances. The editors open the book with a substantial introduction that traces the history of scholarly writing on food and maps the terrain of feminist food studies. In the essays that follow, contributors pay particular attention to the ways in which gender, race, ethnicity, class, colonialism, and capitalism have both shaped and been shaped by the production and consumption of food.",N/A,N/A,en
