The Extended Phenotype,['Richard Dawkins'],1999,['Science'],"In this influential and controversial book that has become a classic in popular science writing, Dawkins furthers his fascinating look at the evolution of life and natural selection.",5,N/A,en
The Selfish Gene,['Richard Dawkins'],1989,['Medical'],"Science need not be dull and bogged down by jargon, as Richard Dawkins proves in this entertaining look at evolution. The themes he takes up are the concepts of altruistic and selfish behaviour; the genetical definition of selfish interest; the evolution of aggressive behaviour; kinshiptheory; sex ratio theory; reciprocal altruism; deceit; and the natural selection of sex differences. 'Should be read, can be read by almost anyone. It describes with great skill a new face of the theory of evolution.' W.D. Hamilton, Science",4.5,N/A,en

The Mendelian Revolution,['Peter J. Bowler'],1989,['Science'],"Aristotle taught that a human embryo grows from a spiritual essence provided by the father. In the eighteenth century, some thinkers imagined preformed miniatures - the entire human race, one inside the other like Russian dolls, placed by God within the womb of Eve. Even when Gregor Mendel's now-famous experiments with peas revealed the existence of what Mendel called ""dominent"" and ""recessive"" traits, other researchers ignored the findings. The history of genetics, argues Peter J. Bowler, is often a history of scientists' religious, political, and social preconceptions. In The Mendelian Revolution Bowler shows how our thinking about heredity and reproduction has changed over centuries. He describes how modern notions of heredity developed, explains what Gregor Mendel's work really meant, and challenges the myth of Mendelism's ""rediscovery"" in the twentieth century. From the example of genetics, he reveals the flaws in the traditional view of scientific progress as an objective search for empirical truth. And he reveals how understanding Mendelism and heredity can help us understand the increasingly complex role of genetics in the modern world. -- from dust jacket.",N/A,N/A,en

The Welfare of Cats,['Irene Rochlitz'],2007-04-17,['Science'],"Animal welfare is attracting increasing interest worldwide, but particularly from those in developed countries, who now have the knowledge and resources to be able to offer the best management systems for their farm animals, as well as potentially being able to offer plentiful resources for companion, zoo and laboratory animals. The increased attention given to farm animal welfare in the West derives largely from the fact that the relentless pursuit of financial reward and efficiency has led to the development of intensive animal production systems, that challenge the conscience of many consumers in those countries. In developing countries human survival is still a daily uncertainty, so that provision for animal welfare has to be balanced against human welfare. Welfare is usually provided for only if it supports the output of the animal, be it food, work, clothing, sport or companionship. In reality, there are resources for all if they are properly husbanded in both developing and developed countries. The inequitable division of the world’s riches creates physical and psychological poverty for humans and animals alike in all sectors of the world. Livestock are the world’s biggest land user (FAO, 2002) and the population is increasing rapidly to meet the need of an expanding human population. Populations of farm animals managed by humans are therefore increasing worldwide, and there is the tendency to allocate fewer resources to each animal. Increased attention to welfare issues is just as evident for companion, laboratory, wild and zoo animals.",1,N/A,en

A Dictionary of Genetics,"['Robert C. King', 'William D. Stansfield']",1997,['Medical'],"Modern genetics began in 1900 with the rediscovery of Mendel's paper, and now the sequencing of the human genome has brought the first century of progress in this field to a triumphant conclusion. Genetics has entered a new era with the advent of genomic and proteomic approaches, and the knowledge in no other biological discipline is advancing as rapidly as that in molecular genetics and cell biology. Proliferation of new terms inevitably accompanies such exponential growth. The sixth edition of A Dictionary of Genetics addresses the need of students and professionals to have access to an up-to-date reference source that defines not only the most recently coined terms, but in many cases also presents important ancillary encyclopedic information.A Dictionary of Genetics has a broader coverage than its name implies, since it includes definitions of strictly genetic words along with a variety of non-genetic terms often encountered in the literature of genetics. There are about 7,000 definitions, and tables or drawings that illustrate 395 of these. In addition to the main body of the dictionary, this work features new Appendices covering the genomic sizes and gene numbers of about 30 organisms ranging from the smallest known virus to humans, an up-to-date listing of internet addresses for easy access to genetic databanks, and a list of developments, inventions and advances in genetics, cytology, and evolutionary science from the past 400 years. These 900 entries, covering a period from 1590 to 2001, are also cross-referenced in the definitions that occur in the body of the dictionary. No other genetics dictionary supplies definitions cross-referenced to chronology entries or has species entries cross-referenced to an appendix showing the position of each organism in a taxonomic hierarchy. These features make A Dictionary of Genetics the most important lexicon in this field.",N/A,N/A,en

The Third Twin,['Ken Follett'],1996,['Fiction'],"The study of twins and the genetics of aggression totally consumes research scientist Jeannie Ferrami. An accomplished and headstrong researcher, Jeannie has developed a sophisticated software program to identify identical twins reared apart. But Jeannie's breakthrough project is threatened by the appearance of a sudden impossibility--identical twins born weeks apart to different mothers at separate locations. When Jeannie's research assistant, Lisa, is raped, Steve Logan, a young law student who is one of Jeannie's research subjects, is identified in a police lineup as Lisa's attacker. Logan's genetic tests reveal no violent behavior patterns. Then Jeannie stumbles upon the beginnings of a stunning revelation. Logan is unaware of the existence of a criminal twin brother in jail. Jeannie is convinced of Steve's innocence, yet her judgment may be clouded by her growing emotional attachment to him. By now Jeannie's problems are mounting. Berrington Jones, Jeannie's arrogant and intimidating boss, is a world-renowned authority on biotechnical engineering. He and his partners are involved in devious but lucrative negotiations to sell Genetco, their biogenetic research company. Jeannie's research poses a major threat to their impending millions. Jones arranges to have Jeannie fired. Stunned and feeling helpless, Jeannie doesn't understand why this has happened to her. With Steve and his brother in jail, who is committing these sex crimes? While acting on a hunch that might solve the mystery surrounding Steve and his brother's birth, Jeannie is violently attacked by yet another twin who looks exactly like Steve. Determined to protect her research program and convinced her former boss has something important to hide, a terrified Jeannie has no other choice but to find out why Jones and his partners will stop at nothing to discredit her work.",3.5,N/A,en

Exploring Personal Genomics,"['Joel T. Dudley', 'Konrad J. Karczewski']",2013-01-03,['Medical'],"Rapid advances in high-throughput genome sequencing technologies foreshadow a near-future in which millions of individuals will gain affordable access to their complete genome sequence. This promises to give unprecedented insights into the fundamental biological nature of ourselves and our species: where we came from, how we are born, how we interact with our environment, how we get sick, how we get well, and how we age. Personal genomics is therefore an important component of the inevitable transition towards personalized medicine, as the medical establishment begins to explore and evaluate the role of personal genomics in health and medicine. However there is currently very little training available for medical practitioners. Exploring Personal Genomics provides a novel, inquiry-based approach to understanding and interpreting the practical, medical, and societal aspects of personal genomic information. It is presented in two parts: the first provides readers of all backgrounds with a fundamental understanding of the biology of human genomes, information on how to obtain and understand digital representations of personal genomic data, tools and techniques for exploring the personal genomics of ancestry and genealogy, discovery and interpretation of genetic trait associations, and the role of personal genomics in drug response. The second part offers more advanced readers an understanding of the science, tools, and techniques for investigating interactions between a personal genome and the environment, connecting DNA to physiology, assessing rare variants and structural variation, and exploring resources for performing personal biological investigation. This advanced textbook is primarily aimed at undergraduate and graduate students taking classes in genomic medicine, genetics, and bioinformatics. It will also be of relevance and use to medical practitioners, evolutionary biologists, geneticists and individuals interested in exploring their personal genetic data.",N/A,N/A,en

Omics Applications for Systems Biology,"['Wan Mohd Aizat', 'Hoe-Han Goh', 'Syarul Nataqain Baharum']",2018-10-31,['Science'],"This book explains omics at the most basic level, including how this new concept can be properly utilized in molecular and systems biology research. Most reviews and books on this topic have mainly focused on the technicalities and complexity of each omics’ platform, impeding readers to wholly understand its fundamentals and applications. This book tackles such gap and will be most beneficial to novice in this area, university students and even researchers. Basic workflow and practical guidance in each omics are also described, such that scientists can properly design their experimentation effectively. Furthermore, how each omics platform has been conducted in our institute (INBIOSIS) is also detailed, a comprehensive example on this topic to further enhance readers’ understanding. The contributors of each chapter have utilized the platforms in various manner within their own research and beyond. The contributors have also been interactively integrated and combined these different omics approaches in their research, being able to systematically write each chapter with the conscious knowledge of other inter-relating topics of omics. The potential readers and audience of this book can come from undergraduate and postgraduate students who wish to extend their comprehension in the topics of molecular biology and big data analysis using omics platforms. Furthermore, researchers and scientists whom may have expertise in basic molecular biology can extend their experimentation using the omics technologies and workflow outlined in this book, benefiting their research in the long run.",N/A,N/A,en
River Out of Eden,['Richard Dawkins'],1996,['Evolution'],"The Number One SUNDAY TIMES bestseller. A fascinating explanation of how evolution works, from bestselling author Richard Dawkins. The river of Dawkins's title is a river of DNA, flowing through time from the beginning of life on earth to the present - and onwards. Dawkins explains that DNA must be thought of as the most sophisticated information system imaginable: 'Life is just bytes and bytes of information,' he writes. Using this perspective, he describes the mechanisms by which evolution has taken place, gradually but inexorably, over a period of three thousand million years. It is the story of how evolution happens, rather than a narrative of what has actually happened in evolution. He discusses current views on the process of human evolution, including the idea that we all trace back to a comparatively recent African 'Eve', and speculates that the �information explosion' that was unleashed on Earth when DNA came into being has almost certainly happened in other places in the universe.",N/A,N/A,en

Mendel's Legacy,['Elof Axel Carlson'],2004,['Science'],"This latest book by Elof Carlson (The Unfit) is a first history of classical genetics, the era in which the chromosome theory of heredity was proposed and developed. Highly illustrated and based heavily on early 20th century original sources, the book traces the roots of genetics in breeding analysis and studies of cytology, evolution, and reproductive biology that began in Europe but were synthesized in the United States through new Ph.D. programs and expanded academic funding. Carlson argues that, influenced largely by new technologies and instrumentation, the life sciences progressed though incremental change rather than paradigm shifts, and he describes how molecular biology emerged from the key ideas and model systems of classical genetics.

The Extended Phenotype,['Richard Dawkins'],1982,['Évolution'],"People commonly view evolution as a process of competition between individuals--known as ""survival of the fittest""--with the individual representing the ""unit of selection."" Richard Dawkins offers a controversial reinterpretation of that idea in The Extended Phenotype, now being reissued to coincide with the publication of the second edition of his highly-acclaimed The Selfish Gene. He proposes that we look at evolution as a battle between genes instead of between whole organisms. We can then view Nanges in phenotypes--the end products of genes, like eye color or leaf shape, which are usually considered to increase the fitness of an individual--as serving the evolutionary interests of genes. Dawkins makes a convincing case that considering one's body, personality, and environment as a field of combat in a kind of ""arms race"" between genes fighting to express themselves on a strand of DNA can clarify and extend the idea of survival of the fittest. This influential and controversial book illuminates the complex world of genetics in an engaging, lively manner.",N/A,N/A,en

Genome, a book of about 100,000 words, is divided into 23 chapters, a chapter for each chromosome. The first chromosome, for example, contains our oldest genes, genes which we have in common with plants. By looking at our genes we can see the story of our evolution, what makes us individual, how our sexuality is determined, how we acquire language, why we are vunerable to certain diseases, how mind has arisen. Genome also argues for the genetic foundations of free will. While many believe that genetics proves biological determinism, Ridley will show that in fact free will is itself in the genes.

His uncompromising honest account of those heady days lifts the lid on the real world of great scientists, with their very human faults and foibles, their petty rivalries and driving ambition. Above all, he captures the extraordinary excitement of their desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling ('America's fabulous chemist') to the solution to one of the great enigmas of the life sciences. This new edition features an introduction by geneticist Steve Jones in which he re-examines the achievement of Crick and Watson in the light of scientific discoveries before and since their work on the double helix.",N/A,N/A,en

Endless Forms Most Beautiful,['Sean B. Carroll'],2007,['Developmental genetics'],"Evo Devo is evolutionary development biology, the third revolution in evolutionary biology. The first was marked by the publication of The Origin of Species. The second occurred in the early 20th century, when Darwin's theories were merged with the study of genetics. Now the insights of Evo Devo are astonishing the biology world by showing how the endless forms of animals - butterflies and zebras, trilobites and dinosaurs, apes and humans - are made and evolved. Perhaps the most surprising finding of Evo Devo is the discovery that a small number of primitive genes led to the formation of fundamental organs and appendages in all animal forms. The gene that causes humans to form arms and legs is the same gene that causes birds and insects to form wings, and fish to form fins. Similarly, one ancient gene has led to the creation of eyes across the animal kingdom. Changes in the way this ancient toolkit of genes is used have created all the diversity that surrounds us. Sean Carroll is the ideal author to lead the curious on this intellectual adventure. He is the acknowledged leader of the field, and his seminal discoveries have been featured in Time and the New York Times.",N/A,N/A,en

New research has also told us that although a distinct type of human, Neanderthal man was not our ancestor. Like eyewitness accounts of Victorian chimney sweeps, the DNA record is an imperfect time machine that can help reconstruct our past. It will also shape our future, as although designed 'naturally' by thousands of millions of years of evolution, mankind will soon be able to redesign itself. But how will such work be guided?

Several countries have only recently opened to field research and highly active local groups have made possible a raft of collaborative studies which would have been impossible even a decade ago. This book presents an overview of the most recent findings in all these fields. New proposals on the relationships of the language phyla of East Asia can now be tested against the findings of geneticists and archaeologists. Recent results on the domestication and spread of rice and millet in particular are taken up both in the archaeological and linguistic papers. Particular hypotheses discussed in the linguistic section include the validity of the Austric hypothesis, the relationship between the Daic languages and Austronesian and the overall links between East Asian language phyla. The chapters on genetics focus particularly on the genetic structure of East Asian populations and the origins of the Austronesian peoples of Taiwan and the minorities of China. Physical anthropology is also considered with a multivariate analysis of East Asian and Pacific populations.

The Social Life of DNA,['Alondra Nelson'],2016,['History'],"The unexpected story of how genetic testing is affecting race in America We know DNA is a master key that unlocks medical and forensic secrets, but its genealogical life is both revelatory and endlessly fascinating. Tracing genealogy is now the second-most popular hobby amongst Americans, as well as the second-most visited online category. This billion-dollar industry has spawned popular television shows, websites, and Internet communities, and a booming heritage tourism circuit. The tsunami of interest in genetic ancestry tracing from the African American community has been especially overwhelming. In The Social Life of DNA, Alondra Nelson takes us on an unprecedented journey into how the double helix has wound its way into the heart of the most urgent contemporary social issues around race. For over a decade, Nelson has deeply studied this phenomenon. Artfully weaving together keenly observed interactions with root-seekers alongside illuminating historical details and revealing personal narrative, she shows that genetic genealogy is a new tool for addressing old and enduring issues. In The Social Life of DNA, she explains how these cutting-edge DNA-based techniques are being used in myriad ways, including grappling with the unfinished business of slavery: to foster reconciliation, to establish ties with African ancestral homelands, to rethink and sometimes alter citizenship, and to make legal claims for slavery reparations specifically based on ancestry. Nelson incisively shows that DNA is a portal to the past that yields insight for the present and future, shining a light on social traumas and historical injustices that still resonate today. Science can be a crucial ally to activism to spur social change and transform twenty-first-century racial politics. But Nelson warns her readers to be discerning: for the social repair we seek can't be found in even the most sophisticated science. Engrossing and highly original, The Social Life of DNA is a must-read for anyone interested in race, science, history and how our reckoning with the past may help us to chart a more just course for tomorrow.",N/A,N/A,en

The passion that furtively develops between them leads Callie to suspect that she is not like other girls. Cal is born twice: once as a baby girl, and again, fourteen years later, as a teenage boy. Through nine generations of the Stephanides family, this genetic secret has slowly passed. It followed Lefty and Desdemona as they fled from the invading Turks in the crumbling Ottoman Empire and into a new life as immigrants in America. Then it followed their son, Milton, who narrowly escaped the race riots in Detroit and went on to build his own hot-dog empire. Now this mutation is about to be dramatically revealed to Calliope. Cal is a skinny and flat-chested fourteen-year-old with the faint hint of a mustache. But these are the least of her problems, as she holds the key to a unique family secret. Her epic story follows three generations of the Greek-American Stephanides family who travel from a village overlooking Mount Olympus in Asia Minor to Prohibition-era Detroit, witnessing its glory days as the Motor City and the race riots of 1967, before arriving in the tree-lined suburban streets of Grosse Point, Michigan.

Gregor Mendel first described genes as abstract units of inheritance in 1865; his work was ignored and then rediscovered in 1900. Thomas Hunt Morgan and his students provided experimental verification of the idea that genes reside within chromosomes during the years 1910-1920. By 1944, Oswald Avery and his coworkers had established that genes are made of DNA. James Watson and Francis Crick published their pathbreaking structure of DNA in 1953. Remarkably, less than 50 years later (in 2001), an international consortium of investigators deciphered the sequence of the 3 billion nucleotides in the human genome. Twentieth century genetics made it possible to identify individual genes and to understand a great deal about their functions. Today, scientists are able to access the enormous amounts of genetic data generated by the sequencing of many organisms' genomes. Analysis of these data will result in a deeper understanding of the complex molecular interactions within and among vast networks of genes, proteins, and other molecules that help bring organisms to life. Finding new methods and tools for analyzing these data will be a significant part of genetics in the twenty-first century. Our seventh edition of Genetics: From Genes to Genomes emphasizes both the core concepts of genetics and the cutting-edge discoveries, modern tools, and analytic methods that will keep the science of genetics moving forward.

Gene Control,['David Latchman'],2010,['SCIENCE'],"""Gene Control offers a current description of how gene expression is controlled in eukaryotes, reviewing and summarizing the extensive primary literature into an easily accessible format. Gene Control is a comprehensively restructured and expanded edition of Latchman’s Gene Regulation: A Eukaryotic Perspective, Fifth Edition. The first part of the book deals with the fundamental processes of gene control at the levels of chromatin structure, transcription, and post-transcriptional processes. Three pairs of chapters deal with each of these aspects, first describing the basic process itself, followed by the manner in which it is involved in controlling gene expression. The second part of the book deals with the role of gene control in specific biological processes. Certain chapters deal with the importance of gene control in cellular signaling processes and for normal development of the embryo. Another chapter discusses the key roles played by gene-regulatory processes in the specification of differentiated cell types such as muscle cells and neurons. The final chapters discuss the consequences of errors in gene control; the relationship between gene misregulation and human diseases, especially cancer; and potential therapies designed specifically to target particular levels of gene control.Gene Control will be of value to students in biological sciences, as well as to scientists and clinicians interested in how genes are regulated in health and disease.""--Provided by publisher.",N/A,N/A,en

DNA Demystified,['Alan McHughen'],2020,['DNA.'],"""""If you're mystified by DNA and genetics, relax. Settle into a comfy chair as we explain what DNA is and how it works its apparent magic, revealing it's not so magical after all. We'll also cover chromosomes, genes and genomics, and how they impact our daily lives. These initial pages provide a quick overview of some common questions folks have about DNA: what it is, what you should know about it, where it comes from. If it seems like we're glossing over your favorite topic, be patient, as we'll explore these and many other topics in greater depth in the subsequent chapters. For now, settle in! It's time to unpack some mysteries and explode some myths, while still marveling at the awesome star power of DNA. Like all celebrities, DNA carries a mystique, a compelling story combining remarkable skills with some manufactured hype. 'It's in our DNA' is now a standard refrain for marketers and individuals trumpeting some essential virtue: honesty, courage, integrity, permanence, the spirit of discovery1. The aura of DNA sells everything from colleges and companies to cars, electric fences, and even literary agents. The marketing hype is often misplaced, but DNA is undoubtedly a wondrous molecule. It's the only known molecule capable of reproducing itself, and is present in all living things. DNA is, indeed, the essence of life itself. Between the Presidential citations, popular television shows such as CSI (Crime Scene Investigation) and a multitude of gratuitous marketing clichés, almost everyone knows ""DNA"". Or, at least, they think they know about DeoxyriboNucleic Acid, aka ""DNA"". The New York Times index shows over 500 news articles on DNA in the first half of 2019 alone, an average of over two stories per day.2 Yet many otherwise well-informed readers don't know what DNA is or how it works.""""--",N/A,N/A,en
Life Without Genes,['Adrian Woolfson'],2000,['Science'],"Bringing together the latest insights from genetics and cyberculture, this book contends that all life can be conceived of as information. It explores future developments in genetics, both as a consequence of Darwinian natural selection and under the influence of genetic engineering. The ideas are illustrated by writing that draws on a range of surreal examples including hypermarkets containing every toy in the universe, pufferfish that think like flies, Peter Pan-like trips through human genes and creatures that evolve in months and not millennia. It argues that the future will be dominated by biological machines evolved artificially by a process of accelerated evolution which is called evolution compression.",N/A,N/A,en
Hereditary Genius,['Francis Galton'],2006-03-30,['Psychology'],"A cousin of Charles Darwin, Francis Galton (1822-1911) was so impressed by Darwin's On the Origin of Species that he decided to investigate in detail the implications of inheritance and evolution for the development of outstanding human abilities. By ""hereditary genius"" Galton meant, ""an ability that was exceptionally high and at the same time inborn,"" and he argued that in the debate over ""nature versus nurture"" (an expression that he coined) nature always prevails.In 1869, he published this, his first, book on the topic, presenting a good deal of evidence showing that exceptional ability often ran in families. In separate chapters devoted to outstanding professionals ranging from English judges to ""wrestlers of the North Country,"" Galton pointed out that most of these high achievers had relatives who also displayed notable abilities. Based on this statistical sampling, he concluded that eminence in any field was due to hereditary factors.Many greeted these results with skepticism, but Charles Darwin expressed his admiration for Galton's results and later cited his work in The Descent of Man. Galton went on to use this initial research as the basis for a new field, which he called ""eugenics,"" the aim of which was ""the betterment of the human race"" through ""appropriate marriages or abstention from marriage."" Although Galton's ideas gained momentum over several decades, they were eventually discredited after being misappropriated by the Nazis as part of their racist ideology. Today, however, with the discovery of heritable diseases, the use of genetic screening to eliminate undesirable traits, sperm banks, and the possibility of ""designer babies"" and human cloning, Galton's groundbreaking research has gained renewed currency and will be the subject of debate for years to come.",N/A,N/A,en
Genetic Politics,"['Anne Kerr', 'Tom Shakespeare']",2002,['Medical'],"""Genetic Politics explores the history of eugenics and the rise of contemporary genomics, identifying continuities and changes between the past and the present. The authors reject the two extreme positions that human genetics are either fatally corrupted by, or utterly immune from, eugenic influence. They argue that today's forms of genetic screening are far from equivalent to the eugenics of the past, but eugenics cannot simply be dismissed as bad science, or the product of totalitarian regimes, for its values and practices continue to shape genetics today.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.
