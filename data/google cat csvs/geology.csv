Petrogenesis of Metamorphic Rocks,['Kurt Bucher'],1994-01-01,['Electronic books'],"The new edition of Winkler's textbook, completely revised by K. Bucher and M. Frey, is written at the same level as the preceding editions. Numerous diagrams showing the stability relations among minerals found in metamorphic rocks help to determine the pressure and temperature conditions under which a given set of metamorphic rocks may have formed. Part I explains basic principles of metamorphism, introduces metamorphic processes and geologic thermobarometry, and defines metamorphic grade. Part II presents in a systematic way mineralogical changes and assemblages found in the most common types of rocks. The computation of the diagrams is based on recent advances in quantitative petrology and geochemistry. An extensive bibliography makes it an invaluable source book for graduate students and professional geologists.",N/A,N/A,en

Santorini and Its Eruptions,['Ferdinand Fouqué'],1998,['Nature'],"Ben Lewin writes and directs this drama about the sexual awakening of a life-long polio sufferer. John Hawkes stars as Mark O'Brien, a writer in his late thirties who has spent his life lying horizontally in an iron lung since a debilitating childhood bout of polio. A poet and a romantic, Mark has lived a life devoid of sexual intimacy. When he is given the job of writing an article about the sex lives of the disabled, he arranges - with the support of his local priest, Father Brendan (William H. Macy) - to employ the services of sexual surrogate Cheryl (Helen Hunt). Their 'sessions' take Mark on an unexpected journey of discovery and self-awareness.",5,N/A,en

Economic Evaluations in Exploration,"['Friedrich-Wilhelm Wellmer', 'Manfred Dalheimer', 'Markus Wagner']",2007-11-29,['Science'],"This textbook, now in its second English edition, is originally a translation of the G- man textbook “Rechnen für Lagerstättenkundler und Rohstoffwirtschaftler, Teil 1”, also translated into the Chinese and Russian languages. Compared to the previous English and German editions the chapters have been updated with new examples and in many cases amended. The textbook is intended for the economic geologist who deals with the evaluation of deposits at an early stage of development. Once an exploration project has reached the feasibility stage, the exact calculations that are necessary for a comprehensive te- nical and economic assessment will be performed by a team of geologists, mining engineers, metallurgists, and economists. In the early stages of exploration, however, any evaluator of deposits must be able to cover the whole spectrum himself. Since only order of magnitude parameters are available at this early stage, the c- culations can only yield order of magnitude results. Precise calculations would even be misleading, since the evaluation does not yet aim at accurate economic assessment but at making the right decision: should the investigation be abandoned or should it be continued at higher costs and with more detailed methods.",N/A,N/A,en

Geodynamics of the Lithosphere,['Kurt Stüwe'],2002-05-27,['Mathematics'],"This book is an introduction to the quantitative treatment of geological problems. It was originally written as a guide for field geologists who wish to quantitatively understand or test their tectonic models. However, the book is an introduction to geodynamics for anyone in the earth sciences. The book provides an understanding of basic concepts of map projections, plate tectonics, heat flow, isostasy, geomorphology, kinematics stress, strain and rheology. In later chapters these concepts are integrated to examine a variety of geodymaic problems: chapter 6 focuses on problems relevant to structural geology, and chapter 7 looks at problems relevant to the field of petrology. In a detailed appendix, a wide range of numerical methods are introduced, such as the finite difference method, Fourier series or the least squares method.

Virtuous Waters,['Casey Walsh'],2018-04-20,['Health & Fitness'],"""Virtuous Waters is the first study of mineral waters and bathing in Mexico. It traces the evolving ideas about these waters, from European contact to the present, in order to shed new light on human-environment relations in the modern world. Our relation to water is among the most urgent of global issues, as increasing scarcity and pollution threaten food shortages, deteriorating public health, and the collapse of aquatic ecosystems. Drawing on ideas from political ecology, the author brings together an analysis of the shifts in the concept of water and a material history of environments, infrastructures, and bathing. The book analyzes a range of issues concerning complex ""water cultures"" that have formed around Mexican groundwaters over time and suggests that this understanding might also help us comprehend and confront the water crisis that is coming to a head in the twenty-first century""--Provided by publisher.",N/A,N/A,en

The Rejection of Continental Drift,['Naomi Oreskes'],1999,['Science'],"In the early 20th century, American earth scientists vociferously opposed the new -- and highly radical -- notion of continental drift. Yet 50 years later the same idea was heralded as a major scientific breakthrough, and today continental drift is accepted as a scientific fact. This insightful book, based on archival sources, looks at why American geologists initially rejected the idea so adamantly while their counterparts in Europe were relatively receptive.",N/A,N/A,en

Mammal Phylogeny,"['Frederick S. Szalay', 'Michael J. Novacek', 'Malcolm C. McKenna']",2012-12-06,['Science'],"The roots of this book and its sister volume, Mammal Phylogeny: Placentals, go back to discussions and plans, shelved for a while, between F. S. Szalay and W. P. Luckett during the international and multidisciplinary symposium on rodent evolution sponsored by NATO, July 2-6, 1984, in Paris. That conference, orga nized by W. P. Luckett and J. -L. Hartenberger, the proceedings of which were published in 1985, proved an inspiring experience to all of the participants, as this was repeatedly expressed both during and after the meetings. In addition to issues relating to rodents, general theoretical topics pertaining to the evolutionary biol ogy and systematics of other groups of mammals regularly surfaced during the presentations and discussions. M. J. Novacek, who was also a participant in the rodent symposium, shared with Luckett and Szalay the enthusiasm acquired there, and he also expressed strong interest for a meeting on mammal evolution with a general focus similar to that of the rodent gathering. In 1988, Szalay and Luckett, after having planned in detail a program, direc tion, and core list of participants, were awarded a $30,000 grant by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation through the Research Foundation of the City University of New York. The grant was contingent upon obtaining additional funds sufficient to assure that the symposium would be held.

Biodiversity and Earth History,"['Jens Boenigk', 'Sabina Wodniok', 'Edvard Glücksman']",2016-10-18,['Science'],"This uniquely interdisciplinary textbook explores the exciting and complex relationship between Earth’s geological history and the biodiversity of life. Its innovative design provides a seamless learning experience, clarifying major concepts step by step with detailed textual explanations complemented by detailed figures, diagrams and vibrant pictures. Thanks to its layout, the respective concepts can be studied individually, as part of the broader framework of each chapter, or as they relate to the book as a whole. It provides in-depth coverage of: - Earth’s formation and subsequent geological history, including patterns of climate change and atmospheric evolution; - The early stages of life, from microbial ‘primordial soup’ theories to the fossil record’s most valuable contributions; - Mechanisms of mutual influence between living organisms and the environment: how life changed Earth’s history whilst, at the same time, environmental pressures continue to shape the evolution of species; - Basic ideas in biodiversity studies: species concepts, measurement techniques, and global distribution patterns; - Biological systematics, from their historical origins in Greek philosophy and Biblical stories to Darwinian evolution by natural selection, and to phylogenetics based on cutting-edge molecular techniques. This book’s four major sections offer a fresh cross-disciplinary overview of biodiversity and the Earth’s history. Among many other concepts, they reveal the massive diversity of eukaryotes, explain the geological processes behind fossilisation, and provide an eye-opening account of the relatively short period of human evolution in the context of Earth’s 4.6 billion-year history. Employing a combination of proven didactic tools, the book is simultaneously a reading reference, illustrated guide, and encyclopaedia of organismal biology and geology. It is aimed at school- and university-level students, as well as members of the public fascinated by the intricate interrelationship of living organisms and their environment.",N/A,N/A,en

Dictionary of Gems and Gemology,['Mohsen Manutchehr-Danai'],2013-03-09,['Science'],"Since World War II the amount of information generated in the science of Gemology has increased tremendously. Therefore this book ""Dictionary of Gems and Gemology"" was written with the aim of providing a ""relatively"" complete dictionary to assist all students, hobbyists, scientists and interested parties in the fields of Gems and Gemology. The forerunner to this book was called ""Dictionary of Gems and Gemology"" (English-Persian, Persian-English, published in Tehran Iran in 1997). It was written with the aid of more than thirty refer ence books relating to gemology. In response to the effort required to clarify the terms within, I decided to compile a book that brings all the relevant terms into one book. This new book eliminates the use of different reference books and compiles nearly all the relevant terms into a one-stop useful text. It took twenty five years to collect the terms and the information so as to present a complete and functional lexicon. The text is supported by nearly 170 illustrations and 21 tables to provide detailed and succinct information. I hope and trust that this book will reach the high standard of other gemological dictionaries. If you have criticisms or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.

In the past, geoscientists have noticed the occurrence of indium in a large variety of ore de posits and detailed geochemical and mineralogical work is available for a few ex amples. However, despite the current technological interest, there is no compre hensive textbook that deals with all aspects of indium mineralization and economics. The present study attempts to develop a general metallogenic concept for indium in identifying the essential enrichment processes and their economic significance. The study 'Indium Geology, Mineralogy, and Economics' was commissioned and funded by the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Re sources (BGR Hannover) and is a contribution to the research program 'BGR 2000 - Raw Materials with Short Lifetime Reserves'. This program focuses on raw materials with known reserves confined to the next 20-25 years at static de mand. The future availability of reserves is usually estimated by dividing the known reserves by the current annual consumption. In fact, lifetimes of reserves are inappropriate measures because they depend on many parameters and there fore represent a ""snapshot"" of a dynamic system. In order to provide a sustainable use of raw materials with short lifetime reserves, a significantly higher amount of innovation is needed compared to raw materials with long lifetime reserves.",N/A,N/A,en

Engrossing, witty, and eminently readable."" --Steve Brusatte, author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs Odds are, where you're standing was once cooking under a roiling sea of lava, crushed by a towering sheet of ice, rocked by a nearby meteor strike, or perhaps choked by poison gases, drowned beneath ocean, perched atop a mountain range, or roamed by fearsome monsters. Probably most or even all of the above. The story of our home planet and the organisms spread across its surface is far more spectacular than any Hollywood blockbuster, filled with enough plot twists to rival a bestselling thriller. But only recently have we begun to piece together the whole mystery into a coherent narrative. Drawing on his decades of field research and up-to-the-minute understanding of the latest science, renowned geologist Andrew H. Knoll delivers a rigorous yet accessible biography of Earth, charting our home planet's epic 4.6 billion-year story. Placing twenty first-century climate change in deep context, A Brief History of Earth is an indispensable look at where we've been and where we're going.

Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical-Chemical Processes in Fractured Porous Media: Modelling and Benchmarking,"['Olaf Kolditz', 'Thomas Nagel', 'Hua Shao', 'Wenqing Wang', 'Sebastian Bauer']",2018-03-01,['Science'],"The book comprises the 3rd collection of benchmarks and examples for porous and fractured media mechanics. Analysis of thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes is essential to a wide area of applications in environmental engineering, such as geological waste deposition, geothermal energy utilization (shallow and deep systems), carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as water resources management and hydrology. In order to assess the feasibility, safety as well as sustainability of geoenvironmental applications, model-based simulation is the only way to quantify future scenarios. This charges a huge responsibility concerning the reliability of conceptual models and computational tools. Benchmarking is an appropriate methodology to verify the quality and validate the concept of models based on best practices. Moreover, benchmarking and code comparison are building strong community links. The 3rd THMC benchmark book also introduces benchmark-based tutorials, therefore the subtitle is selected as “From Benchmarking to Tutoring”. The benchmark book is part of the OpenGeoSys initiative - an open source project to share knowledge and experience in environmental analysis and scientific computation. The new version of OGS-6 is introduced and first benchmarks are presented therein (see appendices).",N/A,N/A,en

Economics of the International Coal Trade,['Lars Schernikau'],2017-01-02,['Science'],"This book is the 2nd edition of the Economics of the International Coal Trade. Coal is the single most important source of power on our planet and today accounts for 40% of electricity generation and 30% of primary energy. The world’s appetite for energy is still far from being met. Until 2050, an additional 6+ billion people will require accessto proper power. “Why Coal Continues to Power the World” introduces the reader to the global coal business; its importance; its source; its global demand, supply and trade; its use; its environmental impact; and its future. Despite recent price hikes, coal does not appear to be a popular subject today, which may explain the little attention it receives in the scientific community. Since writing the first edition during the commodity super cycle in 2006–2008, the world has changed. How has this impacted the global world of coal? This book is useful to energy economists, businessmen, politicians, university professors, high school teachers, students and anyone with an interest in how the world is powered. It is also helpful to anyone studying climate change and global warming. This new edition of the book includes previously not covered special sections on:* Coal analysis and sampling with a special section on moisture * A technical summary of all key coking coal characteristics in Appendix 2 * Coking coal, iron ore and the steel industry * Cement and petcoke markets * Global gas markets and the shale gas revolution in the US * Nuclear energy and the history of the oil market * Renewable energy and the German „Energiewende“ * Power plant technology and CO2 sequestration and processing * The role of CO2 and why man-made CO2 does not cause global warming Apart from giving an in-depth overview of the global coal business, in this book the author argues that coal is far from “dead”. Some of my key messages are contrary to popular beliefs: The importance of coal will further increase in absolute and likely even in relative terms for decades to come. Man-made CO2 has no effect on global temperatures and combustion of fossil fuels does not influence the weather. We cannot stop the advance of coal, we can only make this process as environmentally sustainable as humanly possible. Therefore, mankind needs to embrace coal as the “bridge” from the Oil Age to the Solar Age (through the “New Energy Revolution”). (4) Industrialized nations have to invest in coal and in all means to more efficiently burn coal in order to truly help the global environment and reduce global dust, SOX, and NOX emissions.",N/A,N/A,en

The Pleasures of Probability,['Richard Isaac'],2012-10-21,['Mathematics'],"The ideas of probability are all around us. Lotteries, casino gambling, the al most non-stop polling which seems to mold public policy more and more these are a few of the areas where principles of probability impinge in a direct way on the lives and fortunes of the general public. At a more re moved level there is modern science which uses probability and its offshoots like statistics and the theory of random processes to build mathematical descriptions of the real world. In fact, twentieth-century physics, in embrac ing quantum mechanics, has a world view that is at its core probabilistic in nature, contrary to the deterministic one of classical physics. In addition to all this muscular evidence of the importance of probability ideas it should also be said that probability can be lots of fun. It is a subject where you can start thinking about amusing, interesting, and often difficult problems with very little mathematical background. In this book, I wanted to introduce a reader with at least a fairly decent mathematical background in elementary algebra to this world of probabil ity, to the way of thinking typical of probability, and the kinds of problems to which probability can be applied.

Histaire de L'Astroitomie Anrienne, I. 494. The Hindoos transposed their history, to their fictitious system of astronomical epochs. This transfer occasioned a thousand palpable absurdities; to disguise which, they were obliged to remould their pouranas, to introduce fictions, and prophecies which might correspond with the end they had in view; but these very artifices more clearly display the folly of the enterprise. This system of antiquity, though fitted in many respects to flatter the national vanity, excited numerous reclamations, which continued as long as the memory of the ancient order was preserved. The necessity was then perceived of causing all its vestiges to disappear. There is, indeed, a current tradition that the Mahrattas (Maharastras) destroyed all the works of the ancient astronomers that could be found. ""Finally, it appears that there does not exist at present a single Hindoo book, which can possess an antiquity higher than 1300 years, if it makes the slightest mention of these enormous periods; and that none of the romances called pourmias date farther back from the present time than 604 years, while some of them are more modem still!""

Helium,"['Wheeler M. ""Bo"" Sears, Jr.']",2015-02-19,['Science'],"The subject of the book is helium, the element, and its use in myriad applications including MRI machines, particle accelerators, space telescopes, and of course balloons and blimps. It was at the birth of our Universe, or the Big Bang, where the majority of cosmic helium was created; and stellar helium production continues. Although helium is the second most abundant element in the Universe, it is actually quite rare here on Earth and only exists because of radioactive elements deep within the Earth. This book includes a detailed history of the discovery of helium, of the commercial industry built around it, how the helium we actually encounter is produced within the Earth, and the state of the helium industry today. The gas that most people associate with birthday party balloons is running out. “Who cares?” you might ask. Well, without helium, MRI machines could not function, rockets could not go into space, particle accelerators such as those used by CERN could not operate, fiber optic cables would not exist, and semiconductor chips could not be made...the list goes on and on.",N/A,N/A,en

Ancient Landscapes of Western North America,"['Ronald C. Blakey', 'Wayne D. Ranney']",2017-10-03,['Science'],"Allow yourself to be taken back into deep geologic time when strange creatures roamed the Earth and Western North America looked completely unlike the modern landscape. Volcanic islands stretched from Mexico to Alaska, most of the Pacific Rim didn’t exist yet, at least not as widespread dry land; terranes drifted from across the Pacific to dock on Western Americas’ shores creating mountains and more volcanic activity. Landscapes were transposed north or south by thousands of kilometers along huge fault systems. Follow these events through paleogeographic maps that look like satellite views of ancient Earth. Accompanying text takes the reader into the science behind these maps and the geologic history that they portray. The maps and text unfold the complex geologic history of the region as never seen before. Winner of the 2021 John D. Haun Landmark Publication Award, AAPG-Rocky Mountain Section",N/A,N/A,en

Geology of the Sierra Nevada,['Mary Hill'],1975,['Nature'],"Writing with verve and clarity, Mary Hill tells the story of the magnificent Sierra Nevada--the longest, highest, and most spectacular mountain range in the contiguous United States. Hill takes us from the time before the land which would be California even existed, through the days of roaring volcanoes, violent earthquakes, and chilling ice sheets, to the more recent history of the Sierra's early explorers and the generations of adventuresome souls who followed. The author introduces the rocks of the Sierra Nevada, which tell the mountains' tale, and explains how nature's forces, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, faulting, erosion, and glaciation formed the range's world-renowned scenery and mineral wealth, including gold. For thirty years, the first edition of Geology of the Sierra Nevada has been the definitive guide to the Sierra Nevada's geological history for nature lovers, travelers, hikers, campers, and armchair explorers. This new edition offers new chapters and sidebars and incorporates the concept of plate tectonics throughout the text. * Written in easy-to-understand language for a wide audience. * Gives detailed information on where to view outstanding Sierra Nevada geology in some of the world's most beloved natural treasures and national parks, including Yosemite. * Provides specific information on places to see glaciers and glacial deposits, caves, and exhibits of gold mines and mining equipment, many from Gold Rush times. * Superbly illustrated with 117 new color illustrations, 16 halftones, 39 line illustrations, and 12 maps, and also features an easy-to-use, interactive key for identifying rocks and a glossary of geological terms.",N/A,N/A,en
