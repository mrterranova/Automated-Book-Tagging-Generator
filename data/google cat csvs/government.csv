The History of England,"['Thomas Babington Macaulay Baron Macaulay', 'Thomas Macaulay']",1979,['History'],"This book is the history of England from the accession of King James the Second down to the time that is within the memory of men still living. The author shall recount the errors which, in a few moments, alienated a loyal gentry and priesthood from the House of Stuart. Macaulay traces the course of that revolution which terminated the long struggle between our sovereigns and their parliaments, and bound up together the rights of the people and the title of the reigning dynasty. He shall also relate how the new settlement was, during many troubled years, successfully defended against foreign and domestic enemies; how, under that settlement, the authority of law an the security of property found to be compatible with a liberty of discussion and of individual action never before known; how, from the auspicious union of order and freedom sprang a prosperity of which the annuals of human affairs had furnished no example; how our country, from a state of ignominio! us vassalage, rapidly rose to the place of umpire among European powers; how her opulence and her martial glory grew together; how, by wise and resolute good faith, was gradually established a public credit fruitful of marvels which to the statesmen of any former age would have seen incredible; how a gigantic commerce gave birth to a maritime power, compared with which every other maritime power, ancient or modern, sinks in to insignificance; how Scotland, after ages of enmity, was at length united to England, not merely by legal bonds, but by indissoluble ties of interest and affection; how, in American, the British colonies rapidly became far mightier and wealthier than the realms which Cortes and Pizzaro had added to the dominions of Charles the Fifth; how in Asia, British adventurers founded an empire not less splendid and more durable than that of Alexander. The events which the author proposes to relate form only a single act of a great and eventful drama extending through ages, and must be very imperfectly understood unless the plot of the preceding acts be well known. He shall therefore introduce his narrative by slight sketch of the history of our country from the earliest times. He shall also pass very rapidly over many centuries: but he shall dwell at some length on the vicissitudes of that contest which the administration of King James the Second brought to a decisive crisis. 1st Baron Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-59) was a British historian, essayist, and statesman, best remembered for his five-volume History of England. Baron Macaulay was a minor poet but a brilliant essayist. His History of England has been criticized for its Protestant and Whig bias, but his vast wealth of material, his use of vivid details, and his brilliant, rhetorical, narrative style combined to make it one of the greatest literary works of the 19th century.",N/A,N/A

Steroid Use and Abuse,['Paul K. Roberts'],2010,['Adolescent'],"""Anabolic steroids"" is the familiar name for synthetic substances related to the male sex hormones (e.g., testosterone). They promote the growth of skeletal muscle (anabolic effects) and the development of male sexual characteristics (androgenic effects) in both males and females. The term ""anabolic steroids"" will be used throughout this book because of its familiarity, although the proper term for these compounds is ""anabolic-androgenic steroids."" As discussed in this book, the primary medical uses of these compounds are to treat delayed puberty, some types of impotence, and wasting of the body caused by HIV infection or other diseases. However, steroids can also be abused and this has become so widespread in athletics that it has affected the outcome of sports contests. Illicit steroids are often sold at gyms, competitions, and through mail order operations after being smuggled into this country. This book presents important information related to this problem.",N/A,N/A

The Politics of HIV/AIDS in Russia,['Ulla Pape'],2014,['AIDS (Disease)'],"This book studies the role of civil society organisations in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Russia. It looks at how Russiae(tm)s HIV/AIDS epidemic has developed into a serious social, economic and political problem, and how according to the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Russia is currently facing the biggest HIV/AIDS epidemic in all of Europe with an estimated number of 980,000 people living with HIV in 2009. The book investigates civil society organisationse(tm) contribution to social change and civil society development in post-Soviet Russia, and thus situates a specific type of civil society actors into a broader socio-political context and questions their ability to represent civic interests, particularly in the field of social policy-making and health. This allows for a better understanding of the dynamics of state-society relations in present-day Russia, and gives insight into the ways HIV/AIDS NGOs in Russia have used transnational ties in order to exert influence on domestic policy-making in the field of HIV/AIDS.",N/A,N/A

Governing for Health,['Frances Baum'],2019,['Business & Economics'],"Some aspects of public health vary by locality or jurisdiction. Political challenges are not one of them. As governments on every scale become motivated by short-term economic gains, the essential causes of public health and equity are regularly subject to political questioning and financial shortcutting. Governing for Health is a counterpoint to this myopic approach -- a passionate, rigorous case for why the health of a society is both its greatest measure and its most untapped source of prosperity.",N/A,N/A

She is now forced to ask: How could anyone vote against President Trump this November? What more could you possibly want?

"Evaluation in the Federal Government: Changes, Trends, and Opportunities",['Christopher G. Wye'],1992,['Political Science'],"A significant report on a critical topic, this classic volume of the New Directions for Evaluation series is now in print and available again. This issue, which includes government documents pertaining to evaluation as well as contributions from federal evaluators and administrators, outlines the duties, responsibilities, and methodological approaches of the various government offices with evaluative functions, and details some of the strategies used by these agencies to cope with the twin pressures of reduced funding and greater calls to demonstrate the effectiveness of government programs—pressures first felt in the 1980s and which continue to the present day. The contributors discuss federal evaluation agencies in three broad categories: executive branch social agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where the cutbacks were the most severe; the three so-called central executive branch agencies—the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration—where cutbacks were less severe but still significant, and where attitudes towards evaluation varied over time; and the evaluative agencies of the legislative branch—the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, and the Office of Technology Assessment—where evaluation remained fairly robust and well-funded. This is the 55th volume of the quarterly report series New Directions for Evaluation.",N/A,N/A
