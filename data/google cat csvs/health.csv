De fleste af disse mennesker har en sans for sammenhæng, en generel holdning til at livet er meningsfuldt og til at håndtere. For at finde kilden til denne meningsfuldhed undersøger Antonovsky disse menneskers opvækst, sociale relationer og kulturelle baggrund, og han viser, at en bred variation af medicinske data passer og bekræfter hans teori om, hvordan sociale strukturer og relationer fremmer mestring og sundhed.",N/A,N/A,en

A Guide To Health,['Mahatma Gandhi'],2023-10-01,['Fiction'],As the familiar saying goes; ‘Prevention is better than cure.’ It is far easier and safer to prevent illness by the observance of the laws of health than to set about curing the illness which has been brought on by our own ignorance and carelessness. Hence it is the duty of all thoughtful men to understand aright the laws of health; and the object of this book is to give an account of these laws. The best methods of cure for some of the most common diseases are also mentioned. The author Mahatma Gandhi assures the readers that there is absolutely no necessity for them to seek the aid of doctors. To those; however; who may not be willing to boycott doctors and medicines altogether; he directs; “As possible; possess your souls in patience; and do not trouble the doctors. In case you are forced at length to call in the aid of a doctor; be sure to get a good man; then; follow his directions strictly; and do not call in another doctor; unless by his own advice. But remember; above all; that the curing of your disease does not rest ultimately in the hands of any doctor.” Mahatma Gandhi led a disciplined life and in this book he has discussed in detail the meaning of health; how to live a healthy life and has also suggested some simple treatments for common ailments.

Epidemics,"['Sarah Dry', 'Melissa Leach']",2010,['Law'],"Recent disease events such as SARS, H1N1 and avian influenza, and haemorrhagic fevers have focussed policy and public concern as never before on epidemics and so-called 'emerging infectious diseases'. Understanding and responding to these often unpredictable events have become major challenges for local, national and international bodies. All too often, responses can become restricted by implicit assumptions about who or what is to blame that may not capture the dynamics and uncertainties at play in the multi-scale interactions of people, animals and microbes. As a result, policies intended to forestall epidemics may fail, and may even further threaten health, livelihoods and human rights.The book takes a unique approach by focusing on how different policy-makers, scientists, and local populations construct alternative narratives-accounts of the causes and appropriate responses to outbreaks- about epidemics at the global, national and local level. The contrast between emergency-oriented, top-down responses to what are perceived as potentially global outbreaks and longer-term approaches to diseases, such as AIDS, which may now be considered endemic, is highlighted. Case studies-on avian influenza, SARS, obesity, H1N1 influenza, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and haemorrhagic fevers-cover a broad historical, geographical and biological range.As this book explores, it is often the most vulnerable members of a population-the poor, the social excluded and the already ill-who are likely to suffer most from epidemic diseases. At the same time, they may be less likely to benefit from responses that may be designed from a global perspective that neglects social, ecological and political conditions on the ground. This book aims to bring the focus back to these marginal populations to reveal the often unintended consequences of current policy responses to epidemics. Important implications emerge - for how epidemics are thought about and represented; for how surveillance and response is designed; and for whose knowledge and perspectives should be included.Published in association with the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)",N/A,N/A,en

Beholden,['Susan R. Holman'],2015,['Health & Fitness'],"Winner of the 2016 Grawemeyer Award in Religion Global health efforts today are usually shaped by two very different ideological approaches: a human rights-based approach to health and equity-often associated with public health, medicine, or economic development activities; or a religious or humanitarian ""aid"" approach motivated by personal beliefs about charity, philanthropy, missional dynamics, and humanitarian ""mercy."" The underlying differences between these two approaches can create tensions and even outright hostility that undermines the best intentions of those involved. In Beholden: Religion, Global Health, and Human Rights, Susan R. Holman--a scholar in both religion and the history of medicine--challenges this traditional polarization by telling stories designed to help shape a new perspective on global health, one that involves a multidisciplinary integration of religion and culture with human rights and social justice. The book's six chapters range broadly, describing pilgrimage texts in the Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic traditions; the effect of ministry and public policy on nineteenth-century health care for the poor; the story of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as it shaped economic, social, and cultural rights; a ""religious health assets"" approach based in Southern Africa; and the complex dynamics of gift exchange in the modern faith-based focus on charity, community, and the common good. Holman's study serves as an insightful guide for students and practitioners interested in improving and broadening the scope of global health initiatives, with an eye towards having the greatest impact possible.",N/A,N/A,en

The AMA literally started from scratch to produce this book, so it is in no way to be considered a revision of any previously published title. Special features include: a mil-color Atlas of the Body; sections on 21st century medicine including genetics, brain imaging, robotic surgery, and other cutting edge topics; 40 symptom charts; and a heavily illustrated First Aid section with stcp-by-step suggestions for handling common injuries at home. It has extensive coverage of Alternative Medicine: 80 separate entries and several sidebars that cover the latest in alternative therapies, all edited and reviewed by physicians involved in alternative medicine. The fact that AMA is addressing alternative medicine when the competition largely avoids the topic proves that they know what today's health care consumer wants. AMA Complete Medical Encyclopedia devotes considerable space to mental health issues, with 229 entries on a wide range of Psychiatry topics. It has 129 entries on nutrition, and also covers exercise, sports medicine, and cosmetic surgery. It covers death and dying; home care; geriatric concerns; and specific life stages. Every entry, sidebar, illustration and feature was reviewed by one or more medical doctors, and specialists from dozens of fields reviewed me text and art for accuracy.
