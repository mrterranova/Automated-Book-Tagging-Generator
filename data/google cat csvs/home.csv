A traveler is a seeker after new impressions, fresh impressions of a reality that beckons. Opening to the commonplacewhat stands in front of us on the daily roundwe are open to the call to respond to our role as mediator between heaven and earth. Everyday Spirits is a book about self-perception.",N/A,N/A

The Great Big Book of Families,['Mary Hoffman'],2010,['Families'],"What is a family? Once, it was said to be a father, mother, boy, girl, cat and dog living in a house with a garden. But as times have changed, families have changed too, and now there are almost as many kinds of families as colours of the rainbow - from a mum and dad or single parent to two mums or two dads, from a mixed-race family to children with different mums and dads, from families with a disabled member to those with a mum or dad in prison. Mary Hoffman takes a look through children's eyes at the wide varieties of family life: from homes, food, ways of celebrating, schools and holidays to getting around, jobs and housework, from extended families, languages and hobbies to pets and family trees - and she concludes that, for most people, their own family is the best one of all!

The Nature of Home,['Lisa Knopp'],2002,['Biography & Autobiography'],"For Lisa Knopp, homesickness is a literal sickness. During a lengthy sojourn away from the Nebraska prairie she fell ill, and only when she decided to return home did she recover. Homesickness is the triggering event for this memoir, and its subject is nothing less than what it means to feel at home. Knopp writes masterfully about subjects as seemingly far ranging as place, nature conservation, family, literary foremothers, and the values and beliefs that sustain the individual within an impersonal world. She is passionate about her subject whether it be an endangered beetle in the salt marshes near Lincoln, Nebraska, a forgotten Nebraska inventor, or the roots of Arbor Day as a misguided attempt to ""correct"" a perceived lack in the Great Plains landscape as seen from the sensibilities of eastern settlers.Here is a writer who has read widely and judiciously, and for whom everything resonates within the intricately structured definition of home.Lisa Knopp is on the faculty of the Master of Fine Arts Program in Creative Nonfiction at Goucher College and lives in Lincoln, Nebraska.

HOME,"['Johannes Lenhard', 'Farhan Samanani']",2019,['Ethnology'],"""How are notions of 'home' made and negotiated by ethnographers? And how does the researcher relate to forms of home encountered during fieldwork? Rather than searching for an abstract, philosophical understanding of home, this collection asks how home gains its meaning and significance through ongoing efforts to create, sustain or remake a sense of home. The volume explores how researchers and informants alike are always involved in the process of making and unmaking home, and challenges readers to reimagine ethnographic practice in terms of active, morally complex process of home-making. Contributions reach across the globe and across social contexts, and the book includes chapters on council housing and middle-class apartment buildings, homelessness and migration, problems with accessing the field as well as limiting it, physical as well as sentimental notions of home, and objects as well as inter-human social relations. Home draws attention to processes of sociality that normally remain analytically invisible, and contributes to a growing and rich field of study on the anthropology of home.""--",N/A,N/A

"Diaspora, Memory and Identity",['Vijay Agnew'],2005-01-01,['Social Science'],"Memories establish a connection between a collective and individual past, between origins, heritage, and history. Those who have left their places of birth to make homes elsewhere are familiar with the question, ""Where do you come from?"" and respond in innumerable well-rehearsed ways. Diasporas construct racialized, sexualized, gendered, and oppositional subjectivities and shape the cosmopolitan intellectual commitment of scholars. The diasporic individual often has a double consciousness, a privileged knowledge and perspective that is consonant with postmodernity and globalization. The essays in this volume reflect on the movements of people and cultures in the present day, when physical, social, and mental borders and boundaries are being challenged and sometimes successfully dismantled. The contributors - from a variety of disciplinary perspectives - discuss the diasporic experiences of ethnic and racial groups living in Canada from their perspective, including the experiences of South Asians, Iranians, West Indians, Chinese, and Eritreans. Diaspora, Memory, and Identity is an exciting and innovative collection of essays that examines the nuanced development of theories of Diaspora, subjectivity, double-consciousness, gender and class experiences, and the nature of home.",N/A,N/A

The Home,['Charlotte Perkins Gilman'],1903,['History'],"I hear a deep voice through uneasy dreaming, A deep, soft, tender, soul-beguiling voice; A lulling voice that bids the dreams remain, That calms my restlessness and dulls my pain, That thrills and fills and holds me till in seeming There is no other sound on earth-no choice. ""Home!"" says the deep voice, ""Home!"" and softly singing Brings me a sense of safety unsurpassed; So old! so old! The piles above the wave- The shelter of the stone-blocked, shadowy cave- Security of sun-kissed treetops swinging- Safety and Home at last! ""Home"" says the sweet voice, and warm Comfort rises, Holding my soul with velvet-fingered hands; Comfort of leafy lair and lapping fur, Soft couches, cushions, curtains, and the stir Of easy pleasures that the body prizes, Of soft, swift feet to serve the least commands. I shrink-half rise-and then it murmurs ""Duty!""

Happier at Home,['Gretchen Rubin'],2013,['Biography & Autobiography'],"In The Happiness Project, she worked out general theories of happiness. Here she goes deeper on factors that matter for home, such as possessions, marriage, time and parenthood. How can she control the cubicle in her pocket? How might she spotlight her family's treasured possessions? And it really was time to replace that dud toaster. And what does she want from her home? A place that calms her, and energises her. A place that, by making her feel safe, will free her to take risks. Also, while Rubin wants to be happier at home, she wants to appreciate how much happiness is there already. So, starting in September (the new January), Rubin dedicates a school year - September through May - to making her home a place of greater simplicity, comfort and love. Each month, Rubin tackles a different theme as she experiments with concrete, manageable resolutions - and this time, she coaxes her family to try some resolutions, as well. With her signature blend of memoir, science, philosophy and experimentation, Rubin's passion for her subject jumps off the page, and reading just a few chapters of this book will inspire readers to find more happiness in their own lives.",N/A,N/A

My First Book of Home,['Chiara PIRODDI'],2019-06-06,[],"The book is a collection of activity cards inspired by the Montessori Method. They present fun, practical experiences that children aged three and up can do at home, but they are more than just play materials for the children; they are also cues for parents as to how they can involve their children in home life and how to make their home more ""Montessorian"". Each activity takes place in one room of the house. Children can discover which utensils are used the most in the kitchen, how to set the table, the correct sequence for brushing their teeth, how to put their toys in order, how to organise their bedroom closets, how to make their own library in the living room or how to bring nature to the terrace.

Tribe,['Sebastian Junger'],2017,['Biography & Autobiography'],"From the author of THE PERFECT STORM and WAR comes a book about why men miss war, why Londoners missed the Blitz, and what we can all learn from American Indian captives who refused to go home. Tribe is a look at post-traumatic stress disorder and the challenges veterans face returning to society. Using his background in anthropology, Sebastian Junger argues that the problem lies not with vets or with the trauma they've suffered, but with the society to which they are trying to return. One of the most puzzling things about veterans who experience PTSD is that the majority never even saw combat--and yet they feel deeply alienated and out of place back home. The reason may lie in our natural inclination, as a species, to live in groups of thirty to fifty people who are entirely reliant on one another for safety, comfort and a sense of meaning: in short, the life of a soldier. It is one of the ironies of the modern age that as affluence rises in a society, so do rates of suicide, depression and of course PTSD. In a wealthy society people don't need to cooperate with one another, so they often lead much lonelier lives that lead to psychological distress. There is a way for modern society to reverse this trend, however, and studying how veterans react to coming home may provide a clue to how to do it. But it won't be easy.",N/A,N/A

At Home in the World,['Michael Jackson'],1995,['History'],"Now in paperback Ours is an era of uprootedness, with fewer and fewer people living out their lives where they are born. At such a time, in such a world, what does it mean to be ""at home?"" Perhaps among a nomadic people, for whom dwelling is not synonymous with being housed and settled, the search for an answer to this question might lead to a new way of thinking about home and homelessness, exile and belonging. First published by Duke University Press in 1995, At Home in the World is the story of just such a search, chronicling Jackson's experience among the Warlpiri of the Tanami Desert in Central Australia where he lived, worked, and traveled intermittently over three years. Blending narrative ethnography, empirical research, philosophy, and poetry, Jackson construes the meaning of home existentially, as a metaphor for the balance people try to strike between the world they call their own and the world they see as ""other."" Home is never a stable essence, therefore, but a constantly negotiated relationship between being closed and open, acting and being acted upon. At once a moving depiction of an aboriginal culture, and a meditation on the practice of anthropology, At Home in the World is a timely reflection on how, in defining home, we continue to define ourselves.",N/A,N/A
Struggles for Home,"['Stef Jansen', 'Staffan Löfving']",2009,['House & Home'],"""Based on anthropological studies across the globe, this book explores the experiences and contested meanings of home for people whose lives are characterized by migration related to varying forms of violence. Taking seriously the political implications and exploitation of discourses of home in the transnational processes that connect, yet differently affect, the movement of people and capital, it challenges the sedentarist assumption that territoriality and nation are necessarily the primary determinants of identification. However, it does not replace this sedentarism with a free floating, placeless approach. Instead, through the detailed ethnography of actual experiences of displacement and emplacement, it investigates the power sedentarist discourses may have to provide or prohibit hope. In Struggles for Home the focus is turned onto hope, aspiration and a sense of worth as necessary building blocks in the reconstruction of the social, amidst the violence of political and economic transformation. Research conducted in Sri Lanka, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Zambia, Cyprus, the Palestinian West Bank, Guatemala, and amongst Romanians and Moroccans in Spain articulates a novel theoretical framework for the development of a critical political anthropology of one of the most controversial and fascinating issues of our time - the remaking of home in migration.""--Jacket.",N/A,N/A

Legal scholar Jeannie Suk shows how the legitimate goal of legal feminists to protect women from domestic abuse has led to a new and unexpected set of legal practices. Suk examines case studies of major legal developments in contemporary American law pertaining to domestic violence, self-defense, privacy, sexual autonomy, and property in order to illuminate the changing relation between home and the law. She argues that the growing legal vision that has led to the breakdown of traditional boundaries between public and private space is resulting in a substantial reduction of autonomy and privacy for both women and men.",N/A,N/A

Great Indoors,['Ben Highmore'],2014-12-04,['Families'],"'House' has long been synonymous with 'home': the significance of four walls and a roof lies far deeper than simply shelter from the elements. A house stands for sanctuary, family, belonging, privacy and our pasts: even when standardised as a 'Barratt Home' or modern housing estate, every house bears the stamp of the people who live in it, remaining a bastion of quirky individualism.The Great Indoors is the first cultural history of the family home in the twentieth century, comparable to Rachel Hewitt's Map of a Nation or Joe Moran's Queuing for Beginnners. As society has changed, so has the house: the hall - which had its finest hour during the middle ages, when families and their servants ate, slept and socialised there together - has now been relegated to a mere passageway, only useful for getting to other (more private) rooms. Highmore shows how houses display the currents of class, identity and social transformation that are displayed in the arrangement and use of the family home. And he also offers an engaging and stimulating peek through the curtains to explain why the fridge is used as a communication centre, how the loo (or toilet) inspired its very own literary genre and what your furniture arrangement reveals about how you function as a family.",N/A,N/A
