Caring,['Nel Noddings'],2013-09-14,['Education'],"With numerous examples to supplement her rich theoretical discussion, Nel Noddings builds a compelling philosophical argument for an ethics based on natural caring, as in the care of a mother for her child. In Caring—now updated with a new preface and afterword reflecting on the ongoing relevance of the subject matter—the author provides a wide-ranging consideration of whether organizations, which operate at a remove from the caring relationship, can truly be called ethical. She discusses the extent to which we may truly care for plants, animals, or ideas. Finally, she proposes a realignment of education to encourage and reward not just rationality and trained intelligence, but also enhanced sensitivity in moral matters.",5,N/A,en

The Only Thing That Matters,['Neale Donald Walsch'],2013-09-26,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","The interesting thought that ""98% of the world's people are spending 98% of their time on things that don't matter"" opens the latest book from seven-time New York Times best-selling author Neale Donald Walsch, who says with gentleness that this is the reason so many lives are filled with sadness and turmoil, and that the world itself seems continually on the brink of calamity. This circumstance, Walsch says, is nobody's fault. We simply haven't been told or taught what does matter--or, if that question has been answered for us, the answers we've been given have not been accurate. Yet now, the author declares, the human race is receiving an invitation from Life Itself, in the form of a palpable energy shift in 2012 and beyond, to address the question directly--and people everywhere can feel it. Some sense this shift much in the way they can sense, in the sleepy hours of the morning, that it is time to wake up. Others experience frustration at how things are going right now, but they also feel a muted excitement stirring deep within, a restless readiness to respond to a soft but persistent inner voice that has lately been saying: IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. Walsch says that this inner voice is correct. One's life does not have to be a series of worrisome and challenging crises involving finances or relationship or health or family, and neither does the world at large have to be a container of constant calamity surrounding its governance and ecology and culture. In his latest book, The Only Thing That Matters, he offers a formula, elegant in its simplicity, that will immediately uplift the life of anyone who embraces it--and that could change the World Entire.",N/A,N/A,en

Why Worry about Future Generations?,['Samuel Scheffler'],2018,['Philosophy'],"The things we do today may make life worse for future generations. But why should we care what happens to people who won't be born until after all of us are gone? Some philosophers have treated this as a question about our moral responsibilities, and have argued that we have duties of beneficence to promote the well-being of our descendants. Rather than focusing exclusively on issues of moral responsibility, Samuel Scheffler considers the broader question of why and how future generations matter to us. Although we lack a developed set of ideas about the value of human continuity, we are more invested in the fate of our descendants than we may realize. Implicit in our existing values and attachments are a variety of powerful reasons for wanting the chain of human generations to persist into the indefinite future under conditions conducive to human flourishing. This has implications for the way we think about problems like climate change. And it means that some of our strongest reasons for caring about the future of humanity depend not on our moral duty to promote the good but rather on our existing evaluative attachments and on our conservative disposition to preserve and sustain the things that we value. This form of conservatism supports rather than inhibits a concern for future generations, and it is an important component of the complex stance we take toward the temporal dimension of our lives.",N/A,N/A,en

It drives the headlines that surround us and the laws that touch our lives. From Machiavelli to Hobbes, Freud to Dawkins, the roots of this belief have sunk deep into Western thought. Human beings, we're taught, are by nature selfish and governed by self-interest.Humankind makes a new argument: that it is realistic, as well as revolutionary, to assume that people are good.

One Life,['Morten Albaek'],2019-10-08,['Humanity'],"Never before in history have so many humans suffered from depression, anxiety, and stress. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300 million people struggle with depression - equivalent to 4.4 percent of the world's population, with even more suffering from anxiety and stress. Therefore, it is critical to understand why those of us, especially in prosperous countries with high living standards, continue to get sick, particularly due to work-related stress. Studies have consistently shown purpose and meaningfulness to be essential for performance and mental health in a work place. As a result, human beings are increasingly seeking purpose and meaning in their life. Key to unlocking meaning is the idea that we are all one human being, regardless of the context. It is the purpose of this book to ensure we stop separating our persona into a working human being and private human being, and instead see ourselves as one human being, with one life in one lifetime.",N/A,N/A,en

Humanity and the Nature of Man,['Ebsen William Amarteifio Bsc (Hons)'],2013-06,['Social Science'],"This book is about the invaluable contribution of charities and humanitarians in our world, the benevolence of the majority, and the atrocities of a (very small) minority. Mankind's difficulties often stem from natural disasters, including terrible weather conditions creating human misery. The tsunami and the famine in Ethiopia are typical examples. The other difficulties that have beset humanity from time immemorial are man-made, like wars, slavery, and pogroms. We also have dictatorships, pariah states, and police states, which do not seek to serve their people and alienate the international community. The people in these places become outcasts, despite genuine and determined efforts by others to bring them into the fold. In any society, we see the destructive effects of misunderstanding, greed, envy, hatred, and discrimination. Senseless acts of individual barbarism also pose a problem. Governments, democratic or otherwise, are installed with all the natural and human resources, as well as the goodwill of the global community, to serve and, where necessary, manage the difficulties of the people. History and current affairs indicate that no government is capable of delivering utopia to its people - even those unhampered by ideology, political sensitivities, self-interest, and retribution. Mankind's difficulties are ever so complex. Invariably, the void left has to be managed for mankind to have a life worth living. ""Nature abhors a vacuum,"" so says the adage. Political stalwarts like Abraham Lincoln and courageous clergymen William Wilberforce rise to the fore. This pious hegemony is ably supported by charities, humanitarians, and ordinary individuals who have shown courage and compassion and the willingness to save and improve lives. Charities continue to make the difference. The courage and compassion of Lincoln, Wilberforce, Nightingale, and Mother Teresa may be unsurpassed, but Providence will continue to provide heroes and heroines for humanity.",N/A,N/A,en

Misanthropy,['Andrew Gibson'],2017-06-15,['Philosophy'],"This book is the first major study of the theme of misanthropy, its history, arguments both for and against it, and its significance for us today. Misanthropy is not strictly a philosophy. It is an inconsistent thought, and so has often been mocked. But from Timon of Athens to Motörhead it has had a very long life, vast historical purchase and is seemingly indomitable and unignorable. Human beings have always nursed a profound distrust of who and what they are. This book does not seek to rationalize that distrust, but asks how far misanthropy might have a reason on its side, if a confused reason. There are obvious arguments against misanthropy. It is often born of a hatred of physical being. It can be historically explained. It particularly appears in undemocratic cultures. But what of the misanthropy of terminally defeated and disempowered peoples? Or born of progressivisms? Or the misanthropy that quarrels with specious or easy positivities (from Pelagius to Leibniz to the corporate cheer of contemporary `total capital`)? From the Greek Cynics to Roman satire, St Augustine to Jacobean drama, the misanthropy of the French Ancien Regime to Swift, Smollett and Johnson, Hobbes, Schopenhauer and Rousseau, from the Irish and American misanthropic traditions to modern women`s misanthropy, the book explores such questions. It ends with a debate about contemporary culture that ranges from the `dark radicalisms`, queer misanthropy, posthumanism and eco-misanthropy to Houellebecq, punk rock and gangsta rap.",N/A,N/A,en

The Ethics of Care and Empathy,['Michael Slote'],2007,['Family & Relationships'],"Eminent moral philosopher Michael Slote argues that care ethics presents an important challenge to other ethical traditions and that a philosophically developed care ethics should, and can, offer its own comprehensive view of the whole of morality. Taking inspiration from British moral sentimentalism and drawing on recent psychological literature on empathy, he shows that the use of that notion allows care ethics to develop its own sentimentalist account of respect, autonomy, social justice, and deontology. Furthermore, he argues that care ethics gives a more persuasive account of these topics than theories offered by contemporary Kantian liberalism. The most philosophically rich and challenging exploration of the theory and practice of care to date, The Ethics of Care and Empathy also shows the manifold connections that can be drawn between philosophical issues and leading ideas in the fields of psychology, education, and women's studies.",N/A,N/A,en

Xeelee: Vengeance,['Stephen Baxter'],2017-06-13,[],"Half a million years in the future, on a dead, war-ravaged world at the centre of the Galaxy, there is a mile-high statue of Michael Poole. Poole, born on Earth in the fourth millennium, was one of mankind's most influential heroes. He was not a warrior, not an emperor. He was an engineer, a builder of wormhole transit systems. But Poole's work would ultimately lead to a vast and destructive conflict, a million-year war between humanity and the enigmatic, powerful aliens known as the Xeelee. The Xeelee won, but at a huge cost. And, defeated in a greater war, the Xeelee eventually fled the universe. Most of them. A handful were left behind, equipped with time travel capabilities, their task to tidy up: to reorder history more to the Xeelee's liking. That million-year war with humankind was one blemish. It had to be erased. And in order to do that, a lone Xeelee was sent back in time to remove Michael Poole from history . . .",N/A,N/A,en

Trained as a paleontologist and philosopher, Teilhard was an innovative synthesizer of science and religion, developing an idea of evolution as an unfolding of material and mental worlds into an integrated, holistic universe at what he called the Omega Point. His books, such as the bestselling The Phenomenon of Man, have influenced generations of ecologists, environmentalists, planners, and others concerned with the fate of the earth.

The Living Sea of Waking Dreams,['Richard Flanagan'],2021,['Fiction'],"""From the author of the Booker Prize-winning The Narrow Road to the Deep North comes a wrenching novel of family, climate change, and the resilience of the human spirit--an elegy to our disappearing world. In a world of perennial fire and growing extinctions, Anna's aged mother is dying--if her three children would just allow it. Condemned by their pity to living, subjected to increasingly desperate medical interventions, she instead turns her focus to her hospital window, through which she escapes into visions of horror and delight. When Anna's finger vanishes and a few months later her knee disappears, Anna too feels the pull of the window. She begins to see that all around her others are similarly vanishing, though no one else notices. All Anna can do is keep her mother alive, stay the course that she and her brothers have set. But the window keeps opening wider, taking Anna and the reader ever deeper into an eerily gorgeous story about hope and love, hospital beds and orange-bellied parrots, beauty and solitude and regret. An ember storm of a novel, The Living Sea of Waking Dreams lays bare the interconnectedness of humans and the natural world, and makes an impassioned plea to avert our shared fate""--",N/A,N/A,en

The Pale King,['David Foster Wallace'],2011-03-31,['Fiction'],"David Foster Wallace's last and most ambitious undertaking The agents at the IRS Regional Examination Center in Peoria, Illinois, appear ordinary enough to newly-arrived trainee David Foster Wallace. But as he immerses himself in a routine so tedious and repetitive that new employees receive boredom-survival training, he learns of the extraordinary variety of personalities drawn to this strange calling. And he has arrived at a moment when forces within the IRS are plotting to eliminate what little humanity and dignity the work still has. The Pale King remained unfinished at the time of David Foster Wallace's death, but it is a deeply compelling and satisfying novel, hilarious and fearless and as original as anything Wallace ever undertook. It grapples directly with ultimate questions – questions of life's meaning and of the value of work and society – through characters imagined with the interior force and generosity that were Wallace's unique gifts. Along the way it suggests a new idea of heroism and commands infinite respect for one of the most daring writers of our time. The novel was included on the Best Books of 2011 lists in the New York Times, Time Magazine and Salon. 'The Pale King represents Wallace's finest work as a novelist ... His ability to render the fine finials and fractals and flourishes of a mind acting upon itself, from moment to moment, using only the blunt, numb instruments of language, has few if any equals in American literature.' Lev Grossman, Time Magazine 'Funny, maddening and elegiac ... In this, his most emotionally immediate work, Wallace is on intimate terms with the difficulty of navigating daily life, and he conjures states of mind with the same sorcery he brings to pictorial description ... He aimed to use words to lasso and somehow subdue the staggering, multifarious, cacophonous predicament that is modern American life.' Michiko Kakutani, New York Times 'He was the closest thing we had to a recording angel ... The Pale King contains what's sure to be some of the finest fiction of the year. It's intimidating to have to describe the excellence of some of these set pieces ... People will one day be able to read him and feel what it was like to be alive now.' GQ 'One of the saddest and most lovely books I've ever read ... D.F.W. writes sentences and sometimes whole pages that make you feel like you can't breathe ... Let's state this clearly: You should read The Pale King.' Esquire 'One hell of a document and a valiant tribute to the late Wallace.' Publishers Weekly 'Monumental, almost unbearably poignant.'

Falter is a new call to arms, to save not only our planet but our very souls as well. Over tens of thousands of years, through the harnessing of nature, the development of civilization, and the application of new technologies, human beings have created the world we live in. But as McKibben points out in this provocative and sobering look at the world today, we are fast approaching a tipping point, putting into question the viability of humanity itself. McKibben argues that we have failed to recognize how individual actions often operated against our collective interest, and as a result we now face three daunting challenges - to adjust to a new life on a broken planet, to fight the hyper-individualism that now animates government and business; and to reverse the ways that technology is bleaching out the variety of human existence.

Creatures of Cain,['Erika Lorraine Milam'],2020-11-03,['History'],"How Cold War America came to attribute human evolutionary success to our species' unique capacity for murder After World War II, the question of how to define a universal human nature took on new urgency. Creatures of Cain charts the rise and precipitous fall in Cold War America of a theory that attributed man’s evolutionary success to his unique capacity for murder. Drawing on a wealth of archival materials and in-depth interviews, Erika Lorraine Milam reveals how the scientists who advanced this “killer ape” theory capitalized on an expanding postwar market in intellectual paperbacks and widespread faith in the power of science to solve humanity’s problems, even to answer the most fundamental questions of human identity. The killer ape theory spread quickly from colloquial science publications to late-night television, classrooms, political debates, and Hollywood films. Behind the scenes, however, scientists were sharply divided, their disagreements centering squarely on questions of race and gender. Then, in the 1970s, the theory unraveled altogether when primatologists discovered that chimpanzees also kill members of their own species. While the discovery brought an end to definitions of human exceptionalism delineated by violence, Milam shows how some evolutionists began to argue for a shared chimpanzee-human history of aggression even as other scientists discredited such theories as sloppy popularizations. A wide-ranging account of a compelling episode in American science, Creatures of Cain argues that the legacy of the killer ape persists today in the conviction that science can resolve the essential dilemmas of human nature.",N/A,N/A,en

For many years I have observed seemingly unsolvable human conflicts, the generational damage of bad choices, and the perils of rigid social and economic inequality. I watched one social issue after another emerge, each as dire as the last. I began to wonder, as many do from time to time, if I am really making a difference. As an avid reader of science magazines I began to transfer my interest in the concept of a unifying principle from science to social philosophy. I began to wonder if there was one principle that could explain the myriad of human conflicts and suffering, and perhaps more importantly offer some guidance on a solution. From this curiosity grew serious research into human understanding, and eventually my philosophy on the purpose of life. This book is primarily written from one type of person to others who share the same three traits: being dedicated to making the world a better place, frustrated by realizing that we appear to be losing ground fast, and open to a new context for human life.",N/A,N/A,en

For Rulers,['Yehezkel Dror'],2017-08-18,['Political leadership'],"In this striking book, Yehezkel Dror bravely goes where few authors dare, offering a big-picture view of the fateful choices facing the human species. He urges humankind to adopt unconventional survival and thriving strategies, including elevating the future of humanity above state interests, limiting the production and spread of dangerous knowledge and tools, and strengthening humanity's collective deliberative capacity. The author confronts the evolutionary trap of science and technology ensnaring unprepared humankind by providing it with awesome future-shaping power, which contemporary values and institutions are unable to handle. Dror warns that tribal and nationalist values, the inability to learn from history, and mediocre leadership will catastrophically endanger the future of human life, making radical, even painful, innovations essential. According to Dror, the prevailing form of politics is obsolete.

'No traditional myth is as untruthful as the modern myth of progress. All prevailing philosophies embody the fiction that human life can be altered at will.

Before it's too late, we must stop and ask the big questions: How do we embrace technology without becoming it? When it happens-gradually, then suddenly-the machine era will create the greatest watershed in human life on Earth. Technology vs. Humanity is one of the last moral maps we'll get as humanity enters the Jurassic Park of Big Tech. Artificial intelligence. Cognitive computing. The Singularity. Digital obesity.

The Concept of Humanity in an Age of Globalization,['Longxi Zhang'],2012,['Philosophy'],"Rethinking humanity as a concept in our age of globalization and its relevance to the social and political reality of our times are the topic of this book. It calls for the reclaiming of humanism as an effective response to the conflict, turmoil, and violence we witness in the world today. Concepts of humanity and humanism have become suspect of naivete at best, and guilty of bad faith and repressive ideologies at worst. Yet, hope for improvement is incorrigibly human; the concept of humanity still holds enormous attraction to intellectuals and humanistic scholars. At the same time, it is important to realize that the critique of humanism is very much based on - and limited to - Western social and historical experience. To re-conceptualize humanity and humanism from a truly global perspective will help in relclaiming a more inclusive kind of humanism. In this sense, a cross-cultural perspective is important for reclaiming humanism in our age of globalization. The present volume is the result of such an effort. The diversity of the authors views speaks eloquently to the complexity of the concept of humanity or what constitutes the distinctly human, and therefore the necessity to have an in-depth dialogue on the fate of humanity.",N/A,N/A,en

Be(com)ing Human,['Andrew Stables'],2012,['Education'],"Educational theory is necessarily concerned with what it means to become human, 'becoming' implying a process of growth and change. In general, philosophy of education has tended to view childhood (defined as the period during which one is being educated) as preparation for a settled period as adult citizen, during which one's human nature is given its full expression. Traditionally, then, first we become human, then we are (fully) human. However, when we speak of ourselves as human, we do so in these two senses: as a present species marker, and as a regulative ideal. Most literature focuses on the former sense; the present argument will focus on the latter. What, therefore, should be the grounds for a theory of the individual in society and the world that can best underpin approaches to social policy and education on the assumption that the human animal is always aspiring to fully human status that can never be attained? Central to the argument are the acknowledgment of the human as an open system and the concomitant acceptance of overlapping phenomenal worlds, whereby experience is shared but never exactly duplicated between sentient beings.",N/A,N/A,en

A remarkable character portrait.""--Publishers Weekly The author of The Secret Women tells the story of a brave and enduring woman as indomitable as Ernest Gaines' legendary Miss Jane Pittman, in a breathtaking novel that combines the epic romance and adventure of Outlander, the sweeping drama of Roots, and the haunting historical power of Barracoon. Things Past Telling is a remarkable historical epic that charts one unforgettable woman's journey across an ocean of years as vast as the Atlantic that will forever separate her from her homeland. Born in West Africa in the mid-eighteenth century, Maryam Prescilla Grace--a.k.a ""Momma Grace"" will live a long, wondrous life marked by hardship, oppression, opportunity, and love. Though she will be ""gifted"" various names, her birth name is known to her alone. Over the course of 100-plus years, she survives capture, enslavement by several property owners, the Atlantic crossing when she is only eleven years of age, and a brief stint as a pirate's ward, acting as both a spy and a translator. Maryam learns midwifery from a Caribbean-born wise woman, whose ""craft"" combines curated techniques and medicines from African, Indigenous, and European women. Those midwifery skills allow her to sometimes transcend the racial and class barriers of her enslavement, as she walks the razor's edge trying to balance the lives and health of her own people with the cruel economic mandates of the slave holders, who view infants born in bondage not as flesh-and-blood children but as investment property. Throughout her triumphant and tumultuous life Maryam gains and loses her homeland, her family, her culture, her husband, her lovers, and her children. Yet as the decades pass, this tenacious woman never loses her sense of self. Inspired by a 112-year-old woman the author discovered in an 1870 U.S. Federal census report for Ohio, loosely based on the author's real-life female ancestors, spanning more than a hundred years, from the mid-eighteen-century to the end of America's Civil War, and spanning across the globe, from what is now southern Nigeria to the islands of the Caribbean to North America and the land bordering the Ohio River, Things Past Telling is a breathtaking story of a past that lives on in all of us, and a life that encompasses the best--and worst--of our humanity.",N/A,N/A,en

In delving into the history of animal rights, he also offers a fresh perspective on such varied aspects of Victorian culture as attitudes toward sex, pain, child labor, women, poverty, and science. Turner draws on extensive research in the archives of a animal protection societies, literature of the period, and controversial writings on the treatment of animals. He argues that the dual shocks of industrialization and urbanization helped produce a deeper emotional identification with the natural world. Scientists of the day, proclaiming that human beings were close kin to beasts, not only encouraged but demanded considerate treatment for animals, a sentiment that reached its liveliest expression in the antivivisection controversy. By the turn of the century, the author demonstrates, new conceptions of human nature adn heightened sensitivity even to the plight of lower life-forms were contributing to a new understanding of man's place in nature.",N/A,N/A,en

On Equilibrium,"['B. J.', 'John Ralston Saul']",2002,['Ethics'],"John Ralston Saul explains how our different qualities give us the intelligence, self-confidence and practical ability to think and act as responsible individuals. He argues, however, that when certain human qualities are worshipped in isolation they become weaknesses, even forces of destruction or self-destruction. In short, they become ideologies. How can we use our qualities as positive forces in our own lives - and the life of our society? How can we use them so that each builds upon the other to reinforce us as humans? Saul's answer is Balance. On Equilibrium is an intelligent, persuasive and controversial exploration of the essential qualities of humanity and how they can be used to achieve equilibrium for the self and to foster an ethical society. It is at once an attack on our weakness for ideologies and a manual for humanist action. It is the logical, compelling and humane successor to Saul's bestselling trilogy Voltaire's Bastards, The Doubter's Companion and The Unconscious Civilisation.",N/A,N/A,en
"Body, Soul, and Human Life",['Joel B. Green'],2008,['Religion'],"""Are humans composed of a material body and an immaterial soul? This view is commonly held by Christians, yet it has been undermined by recent developments in neuroscience. How much of Christian theology is built on views of humanity that modern science has proved to be untenable? Exploring what Scripture and theology teach about issues such as being in the divine image, the importance of community, sin, free will, salvation, and the afterlife, Joel Green argues that a dualistic view of the human person is inconsistent with both science and Scripture""--Publisher description (cf OCLC)",N/A,N/A,en
"When Does Human Life Begin? - Scientific, Scriptural, and Historical Evidence Supports Implantation","['John L Merritt', 'J Lawrence Merritt, II']",2012-04-11,['Health & Fitness'],"The elusive answer for the question, ""When does human life begin?"" is one that has not been fully resolved. This book presents a remarkable discussion for all those who would like a fresh approach to this seemingly simple question. This book reviews the status of current medical thinking as well as the history and traditions of the beginning of human life. Startling scientific evidence shows that fertilization is not the final step in creating a new life and scripture never refers to fertilization. The scriptural evidence clearly states that life is in the blood. Ultimately, an inclusive analysis reveals how the implantation of the blastocyst into the wall of the uterus-eight days after fertilization-completes the requirements for a new individual life.",N/A,N/A,en

Global Justice,['Che Guevara'],2002,['History'],"Is there an alternative to the corporate globalization and militarism that is ravaging our planet? These classic works by ERNESTO CHE GUEVARA, icluding his famous essay ""Socialism and Man in Cuba,"" present a revolutionary view of a different world in which human solidarity and understanding replace imperialist aggression and exploitation. Che Guevara was born in Argentina and traveled throughout Latin America before joining the Cuban revolutionary movement that toppled the Batista dictatorship in 1959. Although best known as a guerrilla fighter, this book shows Che as a profound thinker with a radical world view that still strikes a chord with young rebels in every country today. “The powerful of the earth should take head: deep inside that T-shirt where we have tried to trap him, the eyes of Che Guevara are still burning with impatience.” – Ariel Dorfman",4,N/A,en
The Ideal of Humanity in Old Times and New,['John Stuart Blackie'],2019-01-25,['Religion'],"Excerpt from The Ideal of Humanity: In Old Times and New Jove is not Jove merely as a strong launcher of the thunderbolt, but as the assertor of justice, the avenger of perjury, and the pro tector of innocence. Nay, so far is mere special greatness of any description from giving a man claim to the praise of a truly great man, that, as we daily see, there is a strong tendency in the cultivation of any prominent specialty to defraud the other capacities that belong to a well-accoutred human creature, and to disturb the balance of his manhood. Thus it happens that the strong point in a man's professional exercise becomes a weakness in his human character his favourite virtue, like a pampered child, becomes his prominent weakness; the ex aggerated presentment of one feature destroys the fair proportions, in which the beauty of an aesthetical whole consist's and in this way your mere lawyer, for instance, becomes an expert intellectual fencer, your mere poet a blower of splendid soap-bubbles or a colourist of clouds, and your mere parson a bundle of sacerdotal conceit. Let us say, therefore, that a great man is a man who, while in the exercise of his special capacity soaring as high above common men as an eagle above a barn-door fowl, is deficient in no function that makes a man a man. He is in all things essentially and broadly human, and achieves in the exercise of his one special talent the highest excellence, as Shakespeare did in the drama, only by the social atmosphere which he breathes, and the human sympathies which he cultivates.

Bright Shining,['Julia Baird'],2023-11,[],"From the bestselling author of Phosphorescence comes a beautiful and timely exploration of that most mysterious but necessary of human qualities: grace. Grace is both mysterious and hard to define. It can be found, in part, when we create ways to find meaning and dignity in connection with each other, building on our shared humanity, being kinder, bigger, better with each other. If, in its crudest interpretation, karma is getting what you deserve, then grace is the opposite: forgiving the unforgivable, favouring the undeserving, loving the unlovable. But we live in an era where grace is an increasingly rare currency. The silos we consume information in are dotting the media landscape like skyscrapers, and the growing distrust in media, politicians and public figures, have in some ways choked our ability to cut each other slack, to allow each other to stumble, to forgive one another. So what does grace look like in our world, and how do we recognise it, nurture it in ourselves, and express it, even in the darkest of times? From award-winning journalist Julia Baird, author of the acclaimed national bestseller Phosphorescence, comes Bright Shining, a luminously beautiful, deeply insightful and most timely exploration of grace.",N/A,N/A,en

Beauty Will Save the World,['Gregory Wolfe'],2011,['Aesthetics'],"Culture, Not Politics We live in a politicized time. Culture wars and increasingly partisan conflicts have reduced public discourse to shouting matches between ideologues. But rather than merely bemoaning the vulgarity and sloganeering of this era, says acclaimed author and editor Gregory Wolfe, we should seek to enrich the language of civil discourse. And the best way to do that, Wolfe believes, is to draw nourishment from the deepest sources of culture: art and religious faith. Wolfe has been called ""one of the most incisive and persuasive voices of our generation,"" and this penetrating and wide-ranging book makes a powerful case for the importance of beauty and imagination to cultural renewal. He begins by tracing his own journey from a young culture warrior bent on attacking the modern world to a career devoted to nurturing the creation of culture through contemporary literature and art that renew the Western tradition. Along the way, Wolfe finds in Renaissance Christian humanists like Erasmus and Thomas More--and their belief that imagination and the arts are needed to offset the danger of ideological abstractions-- a ""distant mirror"" in which to see our own times. Beauty Will Save the World offers a revealing introduction to the artists and thinkers who are the Christian humanists of the modern era, from well-known figures like Evelyn Waugh and Wendell Berry to lesser-known authors like Shusaku Endo, Andrew Lytle, and Geoffrey Hill. A section on visual artists Mary McCleary, Fred Folsom, and Makoto Fujimura (accompanied by reproductions of their works) demonstrates that there are artists who can reimagine the Western tradition in strikingly contemporary terms. Finally, Wolfe pays tribute to the conservative thinkers who served as his mentors: Russell Kirk, Gerhart Niemeyer, Marion Montgomery, and Malcolm Muggeridge-- all of whom rejected rigid ideology and embraced culture and tradition. At a time when our public discourse has come to be dominated by warring factions with little regard for truth, Wolfe's affirmation of beauty as a redemptive force is both refreshing and encouraging.",N/A,N/A,en

Being human means to be something other than an animal, to not be an animal. Felice Cimatti, with reference to the work of Gilles Deleuze, explores what human animality looks like. He shows that becoming animal means to stop thinking of humanity as the reference point of nature and the world. It means that our value as humans has the very same value as a cloud, a rock or a spider. Drawing on a wide range of texts - from philosophical ethology to classical texts, and from continental philosophy to literature - Cimatti creates a dialogue with Flaubert, Derrida, Temple Grandin, Heidegger as well as Malaparte and Landolfi - as part of this intriguing discussion about our humanity - and our unknown animality.",N/A,N/A,en
