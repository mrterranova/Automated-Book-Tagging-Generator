"Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer",['Kamal Saggi'],1999,['Attributes'],"The author surveys the literature on trade and foreign direct investment--especially wholly-owned subsidiaries of multinational firms and international joint ventures--as channels for technology transfer. He also discusses licensing and other arm's length channels of technology transfer. He concludes: 1) How trade encourages growth depends on whether knowledge spillover is national or international. Spillover is more likely to be national for developing countries than for industrial countries. 2) Local policy often makes pure foreign direct investment infeasible, so foreign firms choose licensing or joint ventures. The jury is still out on whether licensing or joint ventures lead to more learning by local firms. 3) Policies designed to attract foreign direct investment are proliferating. Several plant-level studies have failed to find positive spillover from foreign direct investment to firms competing directly with subsidiaries of multinationals. (However, these studies treat foreign direct investment as exogenous and assume spillover to be horizontal-when it may be vertical.) All such studies do find the subsidiaries of multinationals to be more productive than domestic firms, so foreign direct investment does result in host countries using resources more effectively. 4) Absorptive capacity in the host country is essential for getting significant benefits from foreign direct investment. Without adequate human capital or investments in research and development, spillover fails to materialize. 5) A country's policy on protection of intellectual property rights affects the type of industry it attracts. Firms for which such rights are crucial (such as pharmaceutical firms) are unlikely to invest directly in countries where such protections are weak, or will not invest in manufacturing and research and development activities. Policy on intellectual property rights also influences whether technology transfer comes through licensing, joint ventures, or the establishment of wholly-owned subsidiaries.",N/A,N/A,en
The Moment of Complexity,['Mark C. Taylor'],2003-09,['Philosophy'],"We live in a moment of unprecedented complexity, an era in which change occurs faster than our ability to comprehend it. With ""The Moment of Complexity"", Mark C. Taylor offers a map for the unfamiliar terrain opening in our midst, unfolding an original philosophy of our time through a remarkable synthesis of science and culture. According to Taylor, complexity is not just a breakthrough scientific concept but the defining quality of the post-Cold War era. The flux of digital currents swirling around us, he argues, has created a new network culture with its own distinctive logic and dynamic.",N/A,N/A,en
Information Theory,['Robert B. Ash'],1990,['Computers'],"Developed by Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener in the late Forties, information theory, or statistical communication theory, deals with the theoretical underpinnings of a wide range of communication devices: radio, television, radar, computers, telegraphy, and more. This book is an excellent introduction to the mathematics underlying the theory. Designed for upper-level undergraduates and first-year graduate students, the book treats three major areas: analysis of channel models and proof of coding theorems (Chapters 3, 7 and 8); study of specific coding systems (Chapters 2, 4, and 5); and study of statistical properties of information sources (Chapter 6). Among the topics covered are noiseless coding, the discrete memoryless channel, error correcting codes, information sources, channels with memory and continuous channels. The author has tried to keep the prerequisites to a minimum. However, students should have a knowledge of basic probability theory. Some measure and Hilbert space theory is helpful as well for the last two sections of Chapter 8, which treat time-continuous channels. An appendix summarizes the Hilbert space background and the results from the theory of stochastic processes necessary for these sections. The appendix is not self-contained, but will serve to pinpoint some of the specific equipment needed for the analysis of time-continuous channels. In addition to historic notes at the end of each chapter indicating the origin of some of the results, the author has also included 60 problems, with detailed solutions, making the book especially valuable for independent study.",N/A,N/A,en

Managing Public Organizations,"['Jan Kooiman', 'Kjell A.

It reviews the progress of new management initiatives in the European public sphere; examines the role of the public manager and the organization of public bodies; and considers the potential for change. The contributors reject the notion that there are formulas for management innovation or that general rules from private sector management can be applied. They emphasize the need to develop a concept of management that is appropriate for public organizations.,N/A,N/A,en
An Internet in Your Head,['Daniel Graham'],2022-06-28,[],"Whether we realize it or not, we think of our brains as computers. In neuroscience, the metaphor of the brain as a computer has defined the field for much of the modern era. But as neuroscientists increasingly reevaluate their assumptions about how brains work, we need a new metaphor to help us ask better questions. The computational neuroscientist Daniel Graham offers an innovative paradigm for understanding the brain. He argues that the brain is not like a single computer--it is a communication system, like the internet. Both are networks whose power comes from their flexibility and reliability. The brain and the internet both must route signals throughout their systems, requiring protocols to direct messages from just about any point to any other. But we do not yet understand how the brain manages the dynamic flow of information across its entire network. The internet metaphor can help neuroscience unravel the brain's routing mechanisms by focusing attention on shared design principles and communication strategies that emerge from parallel challenges. Highlighting similarities between brain connectivity and the architecture of the internet can open new avenues of research and help unlock the brain's deepest secrets. An Internet in Your Head presents a clear-eyed and engaging tour of brain science as it stands today and where the new paradigm might take it next. It offers anyone with an interest in brains a transformative new way to conceptualize what goes on inside our heads.",N/A,N/A,en
The Radio Spectrum,"['Bj√∂rn Wellenius', 'Isabel Neto']",2005,['Business'],"Abstract: The radio spectrum is a major component of the telecommunications infrastructure that underpins the information society. Spectrum management, however, has not kept up with major changes in technology, business practice, and economic policy during the past two decades. Traditional spectrum management practice is predicated on the spectrum being a limited resource that must be apportioned among uses and users by government administration. For many years this model worked well, but more recently the spectrum has come under pressure from rapid demand growth for wireless services and changing patterns of use. This has led to growing technical and economic inefficiencies, as well as obstacles to technological innovation. Two alternative approaches are being tried, one driven by the market (spectrum property rights) and another driven by technology innovation (commons). Practical solutions are evolving that combine some features of both. Wholesale replacement of current practice is unlikely, but the balance between administration, property rights, and commons is clearly shifting. Although the debate on spectrum management reform is mainly taking place in high-income countries, it is deeply relevant to developing countries as well.",N/A,N/A,en
Understanding Human Communication,"['Ronald B. Adler', 'George Rodman', 'Athena du Pr√©', 'Barbara Cook Overton']",2023-04-11,[],"Understanding Human Communication addresses students' perception that they already know how to communicate--an issue faced by every faculty member. By artfully weaving cutting-edge academic research and theory into the clear, down-to-earth, and student-friendly narrative, the authors help students understand the complexity and depth of human communication and public speaking. The series of concepts builds logically through the chapter sequence, enabling students to further deepen their communication skills as they progress through the book.

Advances In Negotiation Theory,['Carlo Carraro'],2005,['Bargaining'],"Abstract: Bargaining is ubiquitous in real life. It is a major dimension of political and business activities. It appears at the international level, when governments negotiate on matters ranging from economic issues (such as the removal of trade barriers), to global security (such as fighting against terrorism) to environmental and related issues (such as climate change control). What factors determine the outcomes of such negotiations? What strategies can help reach an agreement? How should the parties involved divide the gains from cooperation? With whom will one make alliances? The authors address these questions by focusing on a noncooperative approach to negotiations, which is particularly relevant for the study of international negotiations. By reviewing noncooperative bargaining theory, noncooperative coalition theory, and the theory of fair division, they try to identify the connections among these different facets of the same problem in an attempt to facilitate progress toward a unified framework.",N/A,N/A,en

Public Opinion and Politics in the Late Roman Republic,['Cristina Rosillo-L√≥pez'],2017-06,['History'],"This book investigates the working mechanisms of public opinion in Late Republican Rome as a part of informal politics. It explores the political interaction (and sometimes opposition) between the elite and the people through various means, such as rumours, gossip, political literature, popular verses and graffiti. It also proposes the existence of a public sphere in Late Republican Rome and analyses public opinion in that time as a system of control. By applying the spatial turn to politics, it becomes possible to study sociability and informal meetings where public opinion circulated. What emerges is a wider concept of the political participation of the people, not just restricted to voting or participating in the assemblies.",5,N/A,en

It elaborates on the algebra of entropy and information, shows how complex models of data are constructed and tested, describes algorithms for exploring multivariate structures using such models, and gives illustrative applications of these techniques. The book is designed as a text but it can also serve as a handbook for social researchers and systems theorists with an interest in communication.",N/A,N/A,en

The various political, social and economic reasons behind the failure to maximize the use of informatics are examined on the one hand whilst, on the other, basic strategies and prescriptions are outlined for seizing the opportunities which will be presented by the availability of cheaper, more accessible technology in the future. One chapter describes in detail the situation in seven different regions, presenting the needs, possibilities, obstacles and prospects in each one.

Dans l'autre, la fausse donne serait le moment d'une tromperie intentionnelle, autrement dit le moment o√π l'on laisserait croire que les choses seraient comme cela et qu'il ne servirait √† rien de changer l'ordre du monde. Que la "" donne "" soit vraie ou fausse, bonne ou mauvaise, ne r√©soudra d'ailleurs jamais la question de sa nature r√©elle ! Existe-t-il une seule mani√®re de distribuer les cartes de la r√©alit√© socio-√©conomique, et la lecture que l'√©conomie propose de cette distribution est-elle unique ou plurielle ? L'auteur propose, √† travers une lecture anthropologique de la dette et du don, une r√©flexion critique sur la valeur de l'information et la mani√®re dont l'√©conomie se r√©v√®le impuissante √† rendre compte de la complexit√© des processus informationnels.",N/A,N/A,fr

Information Security Best Practice Methods for Protecting Your Business,['Institute of Directors Staff'],2005-05-03,['Business enterprises'],"Information Security has never been a more critical business issue than it is today. The advent of ever more sophisticated information and communication technologies - including mobile and wireless - means that businesses are increasingly at risk from information security threats. Security incidents are already remarkably commonplace. According to the DTI's Information Security Breaches Survey 2004, the average UK business recieves 20 or more viruses a year, while larger companies are subjected to one a week. Importantly, the survey also reveals that the vast majority of security breaches are the result of human error rather than flawed technology. The good news is that, in the face of such challenges, there are a number of basic measures that any business can adopt to minimise its exposure to the security threat. Many of these are inexpensive, simple to implement and relevant to companies of all sizes. The Director's Guide describes the key problem areas and gives clear direction on implementing a sound security defence strategy. It includes specific information and advice on: the main threats to your It security managing information security risk the importance of ""the people factor"" what the law says This guide is part of the Director's Guide series, published by the Institute of Directors, which gives UK directors clear, practical advice on key business issues, with real life case studies.",N/A,N/A,en

How Textile Communicates,['Ganaele Langlois'],2024-01-11,[],"Textile has been used as a medium of communication since the prehistoric period. Up until the 19th century, civilizations throughout the world manipulated thread and fabric to communicate in a way that would astound many of us now. Unlike text and images, textile is haptic and three-dimensional. Its meaning is unfixed, constantly shifting as it circulates between different owners and creators. In How Textile Communicates, Ganaele Langlois dissects textile's unique capacity for communication through a range of global case studies, before examining the profound impact of colonialism on textile practice and the appropriation of this medium by capitalist systems. A thought-provoking contribution to the fields of both fashion and communication studies, Langlois' writing challenges readers' preconceptions and shines new light on the profound impact of textiles on human communication.",N/A,N/A,en

Chapters include brand-new readings of The Owl and the Nightingale, the Chastelaine de Vergi, and Marie de France's La√ºstic, and arresting insights into troubadour style, Margery Kempe, and #MedievalTwitter. The book culminates in a medieval(ist) reading of Twitter's premature demise, and Elon Musk's medievalism.

Endogenous Public Information and Welfare,['Xavier Vives'],2011,['Information'],"This paper performs a welfare analysis of economies with private information when public information is endogenously generated and agents can condition on noisy public statistics in the rational expectations tradition. We find that equilibrium is not (restricted) efficient even when feasible allocations share similar properties to the market context (e.g., linear in information). The reason is that the market in general does not internalize the informational externality when public statistics (e.g., prices) convey information. Under strategic substitutability, equilibrium prices will tend to convey too little information when the ""informational"" role of prices prevails over its index of ""scarcity"" role and too much information in the opposite case. Under strategic complementarity, prices always convey too little information. These results extend to the internal efficiency benchmark (accounting only for the collective welfare of the active players). However, received results - on the relative weights placed by agents on private and public information, when the latter is exogenous - may be overturned.",N/A,N/A,en

Averting the Old Age Crisis: Policies to Protect the Old and Promote Growth, the publication for which this technical annex provides supporting documentation, is the third in a series of major World Bank Policy Research Reports. Unlike its predecessors, The East Asian Miracle and Adjustment in Africa, it does not concentrate on a specific region but focuses rather on the general topic of income security for old age. More than two years of research were required to gather data, review the theoretical literature, examine empirical evidence, and write the book that represents the Bank's most important study of the issue to date. This annex explains in detail the data sources, concepts, and definitions used in the book and provides additional information. It describes the demographic data used in the report and discusses data about public and privately managed pension schemes around the world (giving specific sources for individual countries). An attempt has been made to cross-reference the data available on]STARS] diskettes, which can be downloaded and analyzed in most database or statistical software packages.

Mexico,['Monica Tinajero'],2010,['Business development'],"Unlike social programs targeting individuals, few enterprise support programs have been rigorously evaluated, and existing evaluations have mostly been done in high-income countries such as the United States and Europe. Mexico spends a large share of government resources on small and medium enterprise programs each year. How effective these programs have been in achieving their objectives is unclear.

This study finds evidence that participation in small and medium enterprise programs is associated with improvements in key variables such as value added, gross production, and wages. Furthermore, the study finds evidence that some of the positive effects can take several years to realize.

A New Approach for Regulating Information Markets,[],2004,['Information'],"Information markets are markets for contracts that yield payments based on the outcome of an uncertain future event, such as a presidential election. They have the potential to improve decision making and policies throughout the economy. The demand for information markets appears to be increasing. At the same time, there are regulatory hurdles to establishing such markets, largely arising from state prohibitions on Internet gambling. This paper reviews the current regulatory structure for information markets in the United States and offers recommendations for reform. We make two points: first, the authority for regulating many information markets should be shifted from the states to the federal government. Second, the federal government should implement a clear policy that would allow a large number of information market contracts. We argue that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission should regulate certain kinds of information market contracts that are futures contracts. Particular contracts should satisfy an ""economic purpose test"" administered by the CFTC. That test should consider whether an information market contract would allow for significant financial hedging or improve economic decisions. In addition, some types of information markets, such as over-the-counter markets, should remain exempt from CFTC regulation altogether. We believe that the effect of our proposal would be to enhance the development of information markets that improve economic decision making.",N/A,N/A,en

Regulating Innovation in the Digital Age,['Nikita Divissenko'],2025-01-23,['Law'],"This book examines the role, impact, and limitations of regulation as a tool for shaping innovative markets. It contends that the current supply-centred approach is suboptimal in the context of digital innovation and proposes a blueprint for a more demand-conscious approach to regulation. The focus on the demand-side is prompted by the evolving role of consumers within the innovation process in the digital and data-driven economy, the regulatory implications of which are underexplored in legal scholarship. The book features in-depth case studies of the most recent regulatory initiatives in the EU, including Open Banking, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), and the AI Act. It dismantles innovative regulatory instruments, and critically examines their underlying assumptions from an innovation perspective. The new demand-based approach informs the design and use of supply-side market-centred tools, behaviourally-informed demand-side instruments, and technological regulation, by introducing a coherent set of demand-centred considerations. The book offers a regulatory toolbox recalibrated for the digital age and serves as a practical guide for academics, policymakers, regulators, and legal practitioners seeking to understand and engage with the regulation of innovative markets.",N/A,N/A,en

Information Flow and Corporate Governance in Thailand,[],2009,['Good corporate governance'],"This study investigates the relationship between information flow and corporate governance of Thai listed company during 2000-2007. The study uses corporate governance indices which capture major aspects of corporate governance that are board structure, conflict of interest, board responsibility, shareholder rights, and disclosure and transparency. The measurement of private information flow will use firm-specific return variation and Probability of information based trading (PIN) as alternatives of information flow. The results show that corporate governance is negatively related with private information flow. Strong corporate governance reduces private information flow relative to the public information. The better corporate governance will alleviate information based trading and reduce informational asymmetries. Moreover, this study indicates that board structure, conflict of interest , board responsibility are the sub-indices of corporate governance that have a negative relationship with private information flow while the rest sub-indices are not influence with information flow.",N/A,N/A,en
