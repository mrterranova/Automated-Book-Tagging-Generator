Nascent Entrepreneurship,['Per Davidsson'],2006,['Business & Economics'],"Small Firm Growth has two purposes -- to review the extant empirical literature on small firm growth by focusing on small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) and to suggest a framework for integrating our knowledge on small firm growth to guide future research. The authors identify a number of key themes: the conceptualization of small firm growth, assessing small firm growth, factors driving or hindering growth, modes of growth (such as organic growth versus acquisitions), growth stages and transition, and the effects of small firm growth. Small Firm Growth first discusses the nature of the phenomenon of small firm growth and its relation to entrepreneurship as well as size and age. It then moves on to how growth can best be assessed. A major section is devoted to findings on factors that contribute to or hinder firm growth. Following this it offers a section on how small firms grow, if and when they grow at all. In particular, it examines organic growth versus acquisitions; growth through networking and alliances, and international expansion. The next topic treated is 'growth stages and transitions' and the effects of growth in terms of profitability and job creation. Finally, the authors propose a framework for guiding future research and furthering management theory and practice on small firm growth.",N/A,N/A,en
A Social Theory of Innovation,['Alexander Styhre'],2013,['Business & Economics'],"The contemporary economy is primarily understood through the rationalist and formalist lenses of economic theory and its accompanying (mainstream) theories of organization and management. In this corpus of work, the economy is commonly portrayed as emerging on the basis of the calculated and instrumental use of heterogeneous resources. Innovation - the capacity to produce new goods and services, being of key importance in a competitive capitalist economic regime - is a joint collaborative process embedded in social action, i.e., through forms of agency. In contrast to individualist, calculative, and utilitarian images of economic agency, sociologists, historians, anthropologists, and others have demonstrated that economic agency is determined in many cases by social and cultural conditions that extend beyond the narrow sphere of instrumental economic behavior. A Social Theory of Innovation makes a connection between innovation, economic agency, and three complementary perspectives - i.e. those of playfulness, reciprocity, and squandering (the conspicuous and symbolic waste of excess resources) - in terms of being three principles that underlie innovative and creative work. Rather than postulating the homo oeconomicus model of economic agency - prescribed by neoclassical economic theory - as the only possible and legitimate image of economic agency, alternative models exist which in various ways contribute to our understanding of how and why innovation is produced in contemporary society. The book draws on a diverse corpus of literature from management studies, economics, economic sociology, and the humanities to provide a less confined and narrow image of innovation and economic agency. This book is intended for undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate business school curricula in both economic sociology and other educational programs addressing the organization of the economy and society at large.",N/A,N/A,en

Organizing Innovation,['Marcel Veenswijk'],2006,['Business & Economics'],"New Public Management as an administrative reform ideology as well as conceptual innovation has changed the outlook of public administration during the last ten years. Public administration and public administration reform should not only be concerned with the improvement of the efficiency and coherence which play an important role in public administration, but also political values like liberty, equity and security as well as legal values like the rule of the law. The modernization agenda of public administration has a rather internal focus, while the ultimate test for the modernization of public administration is the way in which governments are able to respond to changing social, cultural and economic conditions and the wicked policy problems which result from them. This publication contains interesting contributions to the science and practice of public administration.",N/A,N/A,en

Research Handbook on Gender and Innovation,"['Gry Agnete Alsos', 'Ulla Hytti', 'Elisabet Ljunggren']",2016-09-30,['Business & Economics'],"Innovation is seen as one of the main engines of economic growth. It is generally assumed to be gender neutral when, in fact, the gendered construction of innovation has been traditionally masculine. This Handbookexplores the nexus between innovation and gender by providing a wide range of studies from different analytical and methodological perspectives and from various regional and industry contexts and draws implications for a gender-inclusive innovation policy. The multi-disciplinary group of contributors discuss topics such as gender and innovation in new and small businesses, and growth businesses; addressing innovation in different organizational contexts ranging from public sector health care to mining and forestry; researching gender in innovation policy and in design and materiality. ThisHandbook will be useful to researchers looking to understand parallels between research on gender and innovation on one hand, and research on gender and entrepreneurship or management on the other. It will also be invaluable to students looking for an overview of research in both areas. Contributors include: R. Aidis, G.A. Alsos, N. Amble, E. Andersson, L. Andersson, P. Axelsen, K.-E.

The Dynamics of Innovation in Eastern Europe,['Per Högselius'],2005,['Business & Economics'],"Building strong and dynamic systems of innovation constitutes a key challenge for the post-socialist economies of Central and Eastern Europe. This book develops a strong conceptual and empirical foundation for understanding how such dynamic systems may emerge. The Dynamics of Innovation in Eastern Europeexplains, in particular, how this has been possible in the case of the Estonian system of innovation in telecommunications. The book shows that the socialist historical heritage, and in particular inherited competencies, may be used in highly creative ways for generating dynamic innovation in the post-socialist context. It also uncovers the complex and multifaceted ways in which the geographical and cultural proximity to Western Europe can be creatively used as a powerful resource in the pursuit of building systems of innovation in the East. Moreover, the book demonstrates that it is possible for East European systems of innovation to develop highly creative domestic dynamics without necessarily imitating Western systems or styles of innovation. Providing a unique empirical analysis of how systems of innovation undergo far-reaching transformation and change, this book will be of interest to economists and scholars involved in issues relating to innovation, technology, economic development and East-West integration. Policymakers in the EU and in Central and East European countries and practitioners involved in innovation-related activities will also find it of great appeal.",N/A,N/A,en

Creative Industries and Innovation in Europe,['Luciana Lazzeretti'],2013,['Business & Economics'],"In recent years, the study of creativity has shifted from analysis of culture as an end in itself to one of economic enhancement, and its capability to generate wealth and promote economic development. Increasingly, European cities and regions are using the arts to fuel wellbeing and reinvigorate economies after the comparative demise of more traditional industry and manufacturing. A growing literature is starting to highlight the innovation capacity of cultural and creative industries (CCIs) as they intersect the innovation processes of other manufacturing and services sectors with an innovative and creative output. Culture and creativity may be a strategic weapon to exit the present crisis and redefine an economic model of sustainable development. This book brings together a set of multidisciplinary contributions to investigate the kaleidoscope of European creativity, focussing on CCIs and the innovations connected with them. The two main questions that this volume aims to address are: How can we identify, map and define CCIs in Europe? And how do they contribute to innovation and sustainable growth? The volume is split into two parts. The first part deals with the definition, measurement and mapping of the geography of European CCIs according to a local economic approach, focussing on Italy, Spain, the UK, Austria, Denmark and France. This section surveys the different industrial typologies and spatial patterns, which underline a significant dissimilarity between the North and the South of Europe, mainly due to the difference between heritage-driven and technology-driven countries. The section concludes with a case study on a Japanese creative city. The second part collects some interesting cases of innovation generated in creative spaces such as cities of art or creative clusters and networks. This entails the study of innovations among creative and non-creative sectors (e.g. laser technologies in conservation of works of art and design networks in Italy) and across European and non-European countries (e.g. Spaghetti Western movies in the US or visual artists in New Zealand). Finally, an innovation capacity of culture that can regenerate mature sectors (e.g. the French food supply chain and Swiss watch Valley) or combine the creative and green economics paradigms (e.g. the green creative cities in North Europe) is analyzed. This book will appeal to academics, scholars and practitioners of urban and regional studies, cultural and creative economics and managerial and organization studies.",N/A,N/A,en

Prototype Nation,['Silvia M. Lindtner'],2020-09-15,['Business & Economics'],"A vivid look at China’s shifting place in the global political economy of technology production How did China’s mass manufacturing and “copycat” production become transformed, in the global tech imagination, from something holding the nation back to one of its key assets? Prototype Nation offers a rich transnational analysis of how the promise of democratized innovation and entrepreneurial life has shaped China’s governance and global image. With historical precision and ethnographic detail, Silvia Lindtner reveals how a growing distrust in Western models of progress and development, including Silicon Valley and the tech industry after the financial crisis of 2007–8, shaped the rise of the global maker movement and the vision of China as a “new frontier” of innovation. Lindtner’s investigations draw on more than a decade of research in experimental work spaces—makerspaces, coworking spaces, innovation hubs, hackathons, and startup weekends—in China, the United States, Africa, Europe, Taiwan, and Singapore, as well as in key sites of technology investment and industrial production—tech incubators, corporate offices, and factories. She examines how the ideals of the maker movement, to intervene in social and economic structures, served the technopolitical project of prototyping a “new” optimistic, assertive, and global China. In doing so, Lindtner demonstrates that entrepreneurial living influences governance, education, policy, investment, and urban redesign in ways that normalize the persistence of sexism, racism, colonialism, and labor exploitation. Prototype Nation shows that by attending to the bodies and sites that nurture entrepreneurial life, technology can be extricated from the seemingly endless cycle of promise and violence.

The Dynamics of Product Quality and International Competitiveness,"['Ashoka Mody', 'Deniz Igan', 'Stefania Fabrizio']",2007-04,['Business & Economics'],"Despite the appreciation of the exchange rate, the eight Central and Eastern European countries (the CEE-8) that entered the European Union in May 2004 have achieved a decade of impressive export growth, expanding significantly their shares of world markets. Does this mean that the real exchange rate is irrelevant? If not, what other factors compensated for the appreciation to explain the apparently strong competitiveness of these economies? And will these favorable factors continue to power export growth? This paper places in international context the achievements of the CEE-8 and helps more broadly to identify the determinants of international competitiveness. Building from data at the six-digit level of disaggregation, it shows that the CEE-8 made an impressive shift in product quality and in the technological intensity of exports, and that these shifts associated with the structural transformation were also associated with increased market share. The analysis strongly suggests that, when trading in international markets, countries benefit from higher product quality. However, while the structural transformation achieved was valuable in raising market shares, the easy gains from this process may be over.",N/A,N/A,en

Developments in Telecommunications,"['Edward Mozley Roche', 'Henry Bakis']",1997,['Technology & Engineering'],"Developments in information technology and telecommunications are giving a new meaning to the concepts of space and time. In particular, the concepts of 'local' and 'global' are starting to merge together even though they apparently represent entirely different scales. One example is 'telework', also known as 'telecommuting'. Another is the rapid growth of outsourcing. These developments are based on new technologies such as multimedia, rapid improvements in storage technologies and the information superhighway, including the Internet. The structure of the world's telecommunications industry is changing and in addition, political and social autonomy is breaking down. The role of the nation state is challenged, as are the old avenues and levers of political power. Nation States have attempted to grab functional control over the emerging infrastructure, but they are ultimately unable to exert control over the flood of information surging around the world. There still remains a strong middle ground between local and global, dominated by multinational corporations and national governments.",N/A,N/A,en
"Multinational Firms, Innovation and Productivity","['Davide Castellani', 'Antonello Zanfei']",2006,['Business planning'],"This book gets to the root of how and why multinational firms differ in the cross-border creation, transfer and diffusion of technology, and provides fresh evidence on the effects that these differences have on productivity and innovation in the economic systems in which they are active. Davide Castellani and Antonello Zanfei consider multinationals as heterogeneous institutions that combine internal networks of subsidiaries with external networks of collaborative linkages, to bridge different economic and innovation systems. They examine heterogeneity in productivity and innovative behaviour between multinational and national firms, as well as across and within multinationals. The authors argue that not every foreign firm is a good source of externality, and not every domestic firm is equally well placed to benefit from multinationals. It is shown that spillovers from multinationals differ according to the technological profiles, embeddedness and linkage creation of both foreign and domestic firms active in local markets. The book supports this view with empirical evidence based on illustrative case studies, and on econometric analysis using extensive firm-level datasets on multinational activities, innovation and economic performances. Integrating an in-depth account of state of the art literature with detailed evidence, this book will be of great interest to an extensive audience. This will encompass students, researchers, academics, policy makers and practitioners across a wide range of disciplines including: international business, economics and management of innovation, international economics and industrial organisation.",N/A,N/A,en

System Innovation and the Transition to Sustainability,"['Boelie Elzen', 'Frank W. Geels', 'Kenneth Green']",2004,['Business & Economics'],"Modern societies face several structural problems such as transport congestion and greenhouse gas emissions due to the widespread use of fossil fuels. To address these important societal problems and achieve sustainability in the broad sense, major transformations are required, but this poses an enormous challenge given the complexity of the processes involved. Such transformations are called 'transitions' or 'system innovations' and involve changes in a variety of elements, including technology, regulation, user practices and markets, cultural meaning and infrastructure. This book considers two main questions: how do system innovations or transitions come about and how can they be influenced by different actors, in particular by governments. The authors identify the theories which can be used to conceptualise the dynamics of system innovations and discuss the weaknesses in these theories. They also look at the lessons which can be learned from historical examples of transitions, and highlight the instruments and policy tools which can be used to stimulate future system innovations towards sustainability. The expert contributors address these questions using insights from a variety of different disciplines including innovation studies, evolutionary economics, the sociology of technology, environmental analysis and governance studies. The book concludes with an extensive summary of the results and practical suggestions for future research. This important new volume offers an interdisciplinary assessment of how and why system innovations occur.

Market Oriented Product Innovation,['Knut Holt'],2002-10-31,['Business & Economics'],"Market-Oriented Product Innovation differs from most other titles, written either from a marketing or technical perspective, by giving a holistic view of the product innovation process. It has a product perspective, written from a managerial point of view, recognizing that product innovation, or new product development, is a discipline of its own. It is concerned with managing the products (goods and services) through their life cycle, integrating marketing knowledge and technological expertise, with the aim of getting satisfied customers. The book also gives a thorough treatment of the human and cultural aspects of product innovation by focusing on the change processes needed for the development of a market-oriented culture. The book has practical focus and relevance, due to the professional background of the author, Knut Holt, who has established the field of Technology Management at the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology and is the founder of ISPIM, the International Society for Professional Innovation Management. By linking deep theoretical knowledge with extensive practical experience, the book provides an excellent foundation, whether used as support to courses or for self-studies. The learning is facilitated by about 200 cases and examples from leading companies throughout the world. A unique feature of the book is its dual capacity to serve both as an introductory text, supported by teacher and student manuals, and as a base for advanced studies with more than four hundred references, mainly based on selected key management books and publications from recognized researchers. Each research publication comprises extensive literature reviews and summaries of the latest advances.",N/A,N/A,en
The Handbook of Innovation and Services,['Faïz Gallouj'],2010,['Business & Economics'],"`The Handbook of Innovation and Services is an exceptional volume. Its contributors, including Faiz Gallouj, William Baumol, Jean Gadrey, and Pascal Petit, are among the major thinkers in both the fields of the economics of services and the economics of innovation. Selected topics include the ""cost disease"", services innovation in the global economy, social innovation in the services, and innovation and employment in services. The book, I am sure, will become a standard reference volume in both these fields in the ensuing years.'---Edward Wolff, New York University, USA This Handbook brings together 49 international specialists to address an issue of increasing importance for the world's post-industrial economies; innovation as it relates to services. Contemporary economies have two fundamental characteristics. Firstly, they are service economies in as much as services account for more than 70 per cent of the wealth and jobs in most developed countries. Secondly, they are innovation economies as recent decades have seen an unprecedented development of scientific, technological, organisational and social innovations. This Handbook expertly links these two major characteristics in order to investigate the role of innovation in services, an issue that until now has been inadequately explored and one that poses many theoretical and operational challenges. This comprehensive volume encompasses the views of eminent scholars from a range of disciplines including economics, management, sociology and geography, and draws on a number of different analytical and methodological perspectives. With its multi-disciplinary approach this Handbook will be an invaluable reference source for academics and students in the fields of economics, management and the geography of services and innovation.

They use best practices to support these decisions and sustain their success. These principles - among them, embracing uncertainty, disciplined decision making, and value creation culture - enable companies to make appropriate choices about their R & D planning, portfolio management, and product strategies. Drawing on the experiences of R & D-intensive organizations all over the globe, the authors illustrate the book with best practice examples from companies like Hewlett-Packard, 3M, Merck, Procter & Gamble, DuPont, Monsanto, and AT & T. They stress the importance of evaluating tradeoffs, investigating alternatives, and getting buy-in across functions to ensure that decisions will be viable from both the technological and the managerial perspective. They show how managers can apply these methods more broadly to create a smart organization. The Mathesons clearly demonstrate that changing the decision-making process is an efficient means of reforming culture and improving not just R & D but overall company performance.",N/A,N/A,en

To realize opportunities from continuing advances in science and technology and environmental complexity, the successful firm in the future will be especially good at gaining environmental intelligence, learning and integrating knowledge, and being innovative and flexible. This is not a fanciful prophesy; it is a necessary logical conclusion that Huber draws from an extensive body of scientific knowledge."" --Andrew H. Van de Ven, University of Minnesota, Past President of the Academy of Management, and coauthor of Organizational Change and Innovation Processes""Huber gives a compelling account of the future landscape that many managers have to face today.

Eisenhardt, Stanford University and coauthor of Competing on the Edge: Strategy as Structured Chaos""This is an important book for any manager who faces a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive environment--which is to say, virtually every manager. Huber makes a cogent case for the fact that businesses will face much more dynamic and competitive environments in the future than they face today. More importantly, he offers practical advice for how managers can prepare for the uncertain future they face. Clearly written and carefully grounded in the best research evidence available, this book stands head and shoulders above the many management books offering short-term fads, fashions, and therapies of the moment.""--Richard T. Mowday, University of Oregon, former President of the Academy of Management, and former Editor of the Academy of Management JournalClick ′Reviews′ to read more pre-publication praise for The Necessary Nature of Future FirmsSurvival depends on the ability to read imminent shifts in the environment and respond accordingly. This holds true for any living system, but it is especially true for firms today. The business environment is now changing rapidly, but will change even more rapidly in the future. Only firms that can respond to these changes will survive. It is important to know, then, how business′s future landscape will look. George Huber′s new book, The Necessary Nature of Future Firms, describes this landscape clearly and credibly and makes explicit the organizational attributes and management practices firms must possess to be among the ranks of the ""future firms."" Advances in science and technology will continue to affect business environments, making them more complex, dynamic and competitive. Moreover, this complexity and dynamism will increase at increasing rates. As the book makes clear, successful firms will cope with or exploit these changes by increasing their capabilities for correctly interpreting threats and opportunities, making decisions, acquiring and managing knowledge, innovating, and changing while simultaneously dealing with the needs for efficiency, flexibility, and employee commitment. The Necessary Nature of Future Firms is written for managers, especially those managing change. Professionals in a wide variety of organizational roles will find it a particularly useful reference for its foresight and as an invaluable tool in winning approval for projects and initiatives. Academics in change management, information systems, organizational science, strategy, and human resources management can draw on the book as a supplementary text or as a source for lecture materials. References housed in endnotes rather than in the text contribute to the book′s readability and ease of use, as does the accessible writing style. But for all its accessibility and reader friendliness, The Necessary Nature of Future Firms is still firmly grounded in scholarship. Hundreds of authoritative works and systematic studies specifically inform this book, as do Huber′s own studies and his interviews with over 100 middle- and upper-level managers about changes in their organizations. To add meaning and interest, the book′s insights and conclusions are elaborated with real world examples.",N/A,N/A,en

This timely and prescient book explores the role that Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) played in the pandemic and argues for developing a framework of sustainability, innovation, and global justice in IPR systems, to build a more globally sustainable regime. IPRs impact products and processes which address fundamental societal needs, yet innovation is largely incentivised by the granting of exclusive rights which can limit accessibility to new products and technologies. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Intellectual Property Rights in the Post Pandemic World adopts a cross-disciplinary approach to analyse the relationship between IPRs, sustainability, innovation and the circular economy. Chapters examine pressing issues concerning responding to crises, inventions, the circular economy, follow-on innovation and multi-stakeholder collaboration, among others, as possible ways to finance sustainability. Throughout, this book focuses on how the IP system was challenged by the events of the pandemic, with a view to understanding how IPRs can be used to promote progressive social and sustainable innovation in the future. This book will be beneficial for researchers in intellectual property law and development law along with practitioners and policy makers.

Service Innovation,"['Anders Gustafsson', 'Per Kristensson', 'Gary R. Schirr']",2016-04-15,['Customer services'],"Résumé : The world is being shaped by service. All the world's most advanced economies are dominated by service, with many countries having more than 70 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) generated by it. The service sector also employs the largest number of people and it is the fastest growing sector, both in number of companies and employees. The questions posed in this book are: (1) How is the service sector growing; (2) what is service innovation; (3) what are the drivers of service innovation; and (4) how can organizations innovate service in a structured way? The book views service as the value creating activity that customers perform in their own context: The role of a company is to provide the resources and knowledge to enable value creation. Based on this view, we develop a model of service innovation. Service innovation is a multifaceted concept dependent on the purpose of the innovation. These purposes could be to: differentiate, finance, help, experience, and streamline the process or offering. In turn, these result in: brand innovation, business model innovation, social innovation, experience innovation, process innovation, and behavioral innovation, respectively. In this book, we develop guidelines for what is required from the organizational perspective, how should an organization view its customers in order to be successful, what does a service development process look like, and how to transform an organization that is goods-centric to become service or solution provider. Despite the heightened focus on service in many business sectors, most models and theories of innovation are based on a goods perspective, assuming that the norm is a physical good. We believe that the norm is actually experiential and service based. This book addresses this mismatch of theory and practice for the benefit of those who are seeking to understand, teach, and practice service innovation.",N/A,N/A,en

These are the four elements of strategy which illustrate the integrative nature of strategic management. It quickly becomes apparent that the key to successful strategy is effective integration — of resources, competences, markets, opportunities, organizational structure, culture, environment, innovation, technology, processes, decisions and actions. There are four crucial areas of debate and these are covered in depth. They are:- Boards and Governance — suggests that no element of strategy is better positioned to influence strategy and its integration than senior management. Competition and Core Competences — examines their interdependence and relationship with successful strategy. Organizational Restructuring — discusses organizational types, IT and strategy, managing in a dynamic environment and measurement of strategic performance. Technology — demonstrates relationship between technological change and strategy, structure, culture, and competition; and the relationship between quality and strategy, and integrating technology and marketing strategies. Strategic Integration is concerned with building and maintaining bridges between theory and practice.

"Internationalization, Technology, and Services","['Marcela Miozzo', 'Ian Miles']",2002,['Business & Economics'],"This book examines the way in which the increasing internationalization of services, including the operation of multinationals in this sector, interacts with the process of innovation in services. The book challenges the theoretical traditions that have developed around the analysis of service innovation and internationalization, and argues for a new research agenda. The distinguished contributors address many of the most pertinent issues and adopt a variety of theoretical and empirical approaches to enrich the debates. In contrast to most other books on this topic, this volume pays particular attention to services that are knowledge or technology intensive. It elucidates the process of internationalization of such services (through trade and FDI) and stresses the important role it plays in the globalization of production, distribution and innovation. The book also highlights the significant implications service internationalization can have for the competitiveness of firms, regions and countries. The authors thoroughly evaluate trade and investment statistics in order to identify different modes of internationalization and the substantial cross-national differences that this reveals. They move on to examine the organizational structure of multinationals, the new international division of labour and the factors which can influence the location decisions of knowledge-intensive services. Using extensive survey data from a variety of different countries, they accurately identify the trends, characteristics and drivers which have acted as a catalyst for the increasing internationalization of knowledge-intensive services, as well as the obstacles which can hinder this process. Adopting a truly global perspective, this significant new volume will be of considerable interest to students, scholars and policymakers in the fields of international business, innovation and management.",N/A,N/A,en

Principles of Marketing,['Adrian Palmer'],2000,['Brands'],"This book provides and introduction to the principles of marketing, beginning from the underlying theoretical bases which are often borrowed from the disciplines of economics, sociology, and psychology. Practical application of theory is provided through case studies and vignettes. This booktries not to present prescriptive solutions to marketing problems, but encourages debate about causes and effects. Underlying much of the discussion in this book is the question of whether marketing should be considered a science or an art.In addition to chapters covering the traditional elements of the marketing mix, the book provides insights into issues of contemporary concern in marketing. A chapter is devoted to discussion of the social responsibility of marketing. The growing importance of direct marketing and the role ofelectronic commerce is reflected in a separate chapter. The role of information management is emphasized throughout the book. There is a separate chapter on the marketing of services, although throughout the text an attempt has been made to provide services examples, which reflect their relativeimportance in western economics.Practical applications of theory highlight shortcomings of established frameworks for the study of marketing, and the reader is encouraged to formulate alternative frameworks. Although the book has necessarily been divided into a number of chapter it recognizes that in the real world marketingcannot be neatly compartmentalized in this way. In an attempt to offer a holistic vision, each chapter closes with a summary of how that chapter relates to other chapters. Vignettes and case studies provide integrative perspectives.

Innovation and Automation,['Paul M. Satchell'],1998,['Science'],"Organizational competitiveness requires innovation and automation and current approaches to both hamper creativity. The increasing coexistence of innovation and automation is resulting in each impacting the other in ways that can be detrimental to both. This book links these forces of change positively by shifting the focus on human-machine interactions from the current, technology-centred approach, to one where sharing is evolved and creativity is no longer suppressed.It provides a unique way of understanding innovation in organizations, but using an environmental interaction approach to understanding creativity and its translation into innovatory behaviour. The current dampening of creativity in organizations is made meaningful by explaining organizational behaviour in terms of rituals.The author succinctly assembles the current evidence that the prevailing technology-centred approach to automation is in part responsible for the inability of humans to be creative in work situations. Many of the behavioural constraints necessary for this type of automation paralyse the translation of creativity into innovatory behaviour. In producing an antidote to the technology-centred approach, he moves beyond current human-centred thinking, to an approach where humans and machines share by using the same processes that underlie the sharing between humans. This sharing-centred approach to automation is explained and illustrated.Throughout the book, the current state of human-machine interactions is illustrated with vignettes from aviation, medicine and from organizations. The book also discusses three pictures of future human-machine interactions of the flight deck, in primary care medical practice, and in boardrooms or major organizations.",N/A,N/A,en

Technological Transitions and System Innovations,['Frank W. Geels'],2005,['Innovation'],"This important book addresses how long term and large scale shifts from one socio-technical system to another come about, using insights from evolutionary economics, sociology of technology and innovation studies. These major changes involve not just technological changes, but also changes in markets, regulation, culture, industrial networks and infrastructure. The book develops a multi-level perspective, arguing that transitions take place through the alignment of multiple processes at three levels: niche, regime and landscape. This perspective is illustrated by detailed historical case studies: the transition from sailing ships to steamships, the transition from horse-and-carriage to automobiles and the transition from propeller-piston engine aircraft to turbojets. This book will be of great interest to researchers in innovation studies, evolutionary economics, sociology of technology and environmental studies. It will also be useful for policy makers involved in long-term sustainability and systems transitions issues.",N/A,N/A,en

Corporate Entrepreneurship and Innovation,['Paul Burns'],2020-02-28,['Business & Economics'],"Written by a highly regarded expert on entrepreneurship, this bestselling textbook provides an engaging and comprehensive overview of corporate entrepreneurship. Now in its fourth edition and fully revised throughout, this accessible text is structured in four key parts that cover everything a student needs to know about the topic. After an initial consideration of what constitutes corporate entrepreneurship and innovation, the author then guides students through the four pillars of entrepreneurial architecture: culture, structure, leadership and strategy. The third section focusses on the entrepreneurial mind-set, including how to encourage creativity, business ideas and developing concepts. Finally, the book draws attention to corporate venturing, examining venture teams, intrapreneurs, market development and the role of shareholder value. It is no longer sufficient for businesses to grow simply by cutting costs and taking over competitors. To achieve true success, organisations must avoid an ageing product or service portfolio to bring new, innovative ideas to market. Corporate entrepreneurship is inherently risky and therefore requires a fresh approach to strategy. The approach Paul Burns offers will successfully overcome barriers to launching new ideas, internal challenges of managing creativity and show how to foster an entrepreneurial culture. This is the go-to textbook for all students studying Corporate Entrepreneurship, Intrapreneurship or Corporate Venturing at undergraduate, postgraduate or MBA level. The book is also essential reading for courses on Strategic Entrepreneurship and Innovation. New to this Edition: - Fully revised and updated content throughout with new four-part structure - Brand new case studies in every chapter, featuring some of the world's highest profile companies from across the globe - A greater focus on innovation, including a new chapter on this topic at the start of the book - New chapters on 'Developing a Business Model', 'Managing Change' and 'Managing Risk' - New on-page glossary with key terms highlighted in the text and defined in the margins - New Activities and Group Discussion topics at the end of each chapter",N/A,N/A,en

Out of the Box,['Gunter Pauli'],2004,['Business & Economics'],"The 21 fairy tales in Gunter Pauli's Out of the Box prepare companies, executives and their teams to be the pioneering agents of transformation, as well as promising to be both fun and profitable. Each concept is clarified with a concrete, brief business case. Some are successes, some failures. Examples are based on first-hand experiences from 20 different companies, some large multinationals, some small niche players, some venture capital-funded innovation companies operating in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. Creativity and innovation are not the exclusive domain of the North and the multinational corporation; it also is happening in the Southern Hemisphere. Those executives who embrace these concepts of creativity, innovation and leadership will bring business to the forefront of society, responding to people's requirements in co-evolution with nature, strengthening culture and tradition, as well as creating a wonderful platform upon which entrepreneurs will thrive, wherever they are in the world.",N/A,N/A,en

Nanovation,"['Kevin Freiberg', 'Jackie Freiberg', 'Dain Dunston']",2011-08-23,['Business & Economics'],"Nanovation is a story of how a little car is teaching the world to think big. One dreary, rainy morning in India, Ratan Naval Tata, the Chairman of the Tata Group, was driving to work, right behind a family of four. It wasn’t an unfamiliar sight, all four of them crammed onto a single scooter, trying to get to school and work. Then it happened—a busy intersection, a slick road, and down they went, scooter one direction, family members the other. Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt because the congested traffic had been moving so slowly. But it gave new impetus to an idea Tata had been working on: as the chairman of a car company, how could he get Indian families off scooters and into something safer that they could afford? Today we have the answer, and it’s called the Nano, the least expensive—and arguably most significant—car in the world. Nanovation is not only the story of one car; it represents the leading edge of a revolution in business thinking and design that will have a profound effect on everything that comes after it, not just in the automotive industry, not just in India, but in every industry around the world.",N/A,N/A,en

Industry and Innovation in the North East of England,['Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: North East Regional Committee'],2009,['Business & Economics'],"In this report, from the North East Regional Committee (HCP 169, session 2009-10, ISBN 9780215542731), renewable industries could lead a recovery in the North East's manufacturing industry. The Committee states that the region is well placed to benefit from the growing global market for green technologies, but warns that British innovation and ideas could be lost as other countries benefit from quicker commercial development and implementation. World-class renewable energy companies in the North East - such as the New and Renewable Energy Centre (NaREC) at Blyth, the North East Process Industries Cluster (NEPIC) on Teesside, and NETPark, the North East Technology park in County Durham - could put the region at the forefront of the Government's efforts to turn the UK into a low-carbon economy. The Committee warns though, that the UK's cumbersome and slow planning process poses a significant risk to long-term development in the North East as businesses from countries like China seek quicker, guaranteed sites elsewhere in Europe. The report also states that the Government should explore incentives to encourage local development of renewable and clean energy. Also, underinvestment in transport links is proving detrimental to investment in the region.",N/A,N/A,en

Rapid Product Development,"['Naoya Ikawa', 'Fumihiko Kimura', 'Takeshi Kishinami']",1997-07-31,['Business & Economics'],"Rapid Product Development is a spectrum of integrated actlYllles from initial requirements through research & development, design, simulation, modeling, analysis, prototyping, testing, production, deployment, training, maintenance, repair, disposal and recycling, along with many other intermediate and supporting elements such as quality, reliability, information integration and supporting infrastructures. This term distinguishes leading edge manufacturing technologies, processes, information systems and management practices from their more conventional predecessors in traditional manufacturing systems. The increased speed and flexibility of the new rapid product development processes correspond to greatly reduced time to market for new products, by changing the basic nature of product realization. It is therefore necessary to take account of aspects such as technology integration, cost, quality and time management, team work and business process organization and the supporting functions of data processing, to guarantee the rapid development of innovative products. Key technologies for Rapid Product Development include such topics as Rapid Prototyping, New Generative Manufacturing Methods, Design and Information Management, Virtual Prototyping and Reverse Engineering. This book is a collection of relevant papers which are related with these topics. It contains invited papers for technical trends of Rapid Product Development, and it also serves as a basis for further advanced researches.",N/A,N/A,en

Something Really New,['Denis J. Hauptly'],2008,['Creative ability in business'],"CEO Refresher The Best Books of 2007 Product innovation is the key to business growth. But many books deal with innovation from the business process view alone, or confuse innovation with creativity. Written by an innovation expert whose products generate more than one billion dollars in annual revenue, Something Really New introduces a straightforward but powerful framework for creating exciting new product and service concepts ... simply by asking three essential questions. From an electronic hotel kiosk that provides return airline boarding passes for guests, to something as mundane as the evolution of the toaster, the book provides entertaining, illuminating examples that show how to determine what customer needs aren't being met, using simple methods to arrive at revolutionary conclusions. For example, ""What is a product really used for?"" The question may seem elementary, but the right answer is far from obvious. This and other key questions demonstrate how readers can move beyond mere market research to get to the root of real innovation.
