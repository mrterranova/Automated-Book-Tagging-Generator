Developing Models in Science Education,"['J.K. Gilbert', 'C. Boulter']",2000-11-30,['Science'],"Models and modelling play a central role in the nature of science, in its conduct, in the accreditation and dissemination of its outcomes, as well as forming a bridge to technology. They therefore have an important place in both the formal and informal science education provision made for people of all ages. This book is a product of five years collaborative work by eighteen researchers from four countries. It addresses four key issues: the roles of models in science and their implications for science education; the place of models in curricula for major science subjects; the ways that models can be presented to, are learned about, and can be produced by, individuals; the implications of all these for research and for science teacher education. The work draws on insights from the history and philosophy of science, cognitive psychology, sociology, linguistics, and classroom research, to establish what may be done and what is done. The book will be of interest to researchers in science education and to those taking courses of advanced study throughout the world.",N/A,N/A,en

Learner-Centered Teaching Activities for Environmental and Sustainability Studies,['Loren B. Byrne'],2016-03-31,['Science'],"Learner-centered teaching is a pedagogical approach that emphasizes the roles of students as participants in and drivers of their own learning. Learner-centered teaching activities go beyond traditional lecturing by helping students construct their own understanding of information, develop skills via hands-on engagement, and encourage personal reflection through metacognitive tasks. In addition, learner-centered classroom approaches may challenge students’ preconceived notions and expand their thinking by confronting them with thought-provoking statements, tasks or scenarios that cause them to pay closer attention and cognitively “see” a topic from new perspectives. Many types of pedagogy fall under the umbrella of learner-centered teaching including laboratory work, group discussions, service and project-based learning, and student-led research, among others. Unfortunately, it is often not possible to use some of these valuable methods in all course situations given constraints of money, space, instructor expertise, class-meeting and instructor preparation time, and the availability of prepared lesson plans and material. Thus, a major challenge for many instructors is how to integrate learner-centered activities widely into their courses. The broad goal of this volume is to help advance environmental education practices that help increase students’ environmental literacy. Having a diverse collection of learner-centered teaching activities is especially useful for helping students develop their environmental literacy because such approaches can help them connect more personally with the material thus increasing the chances for altering the affective and behavioral dimensions of their environmental literacy. This volume differentiates itself from others by providing a unique and diverse collection of classroom activities that can help students develop their knowledge, skills and personal views about many contemporary environmental and sustainability issues. ​ ​ ​",N/A,N/A,en

Science Teachers’ Use of Visual Representations,"['Billie Eilam', 'John K. Gilbert']",2014-07-24,['Science'],"This book examines the diverse use of visual representations by teachers in the science classroom. It contains unique pedagogies related to the use of visualization, presents original curriculum materials as well as explores future possibilities. The book begins by looking at the significance of visual representations in the teaching of science. It then goes on to detail two recent innovations in the field: simulations and slowmation, a process of explicit visualization. It also evaluates the way teachers have used different diagrams to illustrate concepts in biology and chemistry. Next, the book explores the use of visual representations in culturally diverse classrooms, including the implication of culture for teachers’ use of representations, the crucial importance of language in the design and use of visualizations and visualizations in popular books about chemistry. It also shows the place of visualizations in the growing use of informal, self-directed science education. Overall, the book concludes that if the potential of visualizations in science education is to be realized in the future, the subject must be included in both pre-service and in-service teacher education. It explores ways to develop science teachers’ representational competence and details the impact that this will have on their teaching. The worldwide trend towards providing science education for all, coupled with the increased availability of color printing, access to personal computers and projection facilities, has lead to a more extensive and diverse use of visual representations in the classroom. This book offers unique insights into the relationship between visual representations and science education, making it an ideal resource for educators as well as researchers in science education, visualization and pedagogy.",N/A,N/A,en

Content-based Language Learning in Multilingual Educational Environments,"['Maria Juan-Garau', 'Joana Salazar-Noguera']",2014-11-28,['Education'],"The spread of English as an international language along with the desire to maintain local languages lead us to consider multilingualism as the norm rather than the exception. Consequently, bi/multilingual education has bloomed over the last decades. This volume deals with one such type of education currently in the spotlight as an essentially European strategy to multilingualism, CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning), in which curricular content is taught through a foreign language. The book contributes new empirical evidence on its effects on linguistic and attitudinal outcomes focusing on bi/multilingual learners who acquire English as an additional language. Moreover, it presents critical analyses of factors influencing multilingual education, the effects of CLIL on both language and content learning, and the contrast between CLIL and other models of instruction. The research presented suggests that CLIL can greatly enhance language acquisition in multilingual settings.",N/A,N/A,en

Consisting of twenty-four chapters, including an introduction and conclusion, it argues that informational content should not be the main element of education, and that to provide more for learners, it is necessary to go beyond content and address other skills and capabilities. It also discusses the false premise that learning is complete when the information is known, not when learners seek more: their own directions, answers, and ideas. The authors assert that the ability to synthesize, solve problems and generate ideas is not based on specific content, although education often focuses solely on teaching content. Further, they state that content can be separated from the learning process and that instructional design and educational technology must be about the skills, habits, and beliefs to be learned.",N/A,N/A,en

Seeing Education on Film,['Alexis Gibbs'],2019,['Art'],"This book argues that films have more to offer by way of conceptualising education than textual scholarship. It considers the inadequacies of trying to define education in any absolute or metaphysical sense, favouring instead explorations of how the concept comes to feature meaningfully in our language through the relationship between the verbal and the visual, word and world. Drawing on the work of the later Wittgenstein, it suggests that a shift in our philosophical focus from knowing to seeing can allow for the phenomena of our ordinary educational experience (teachers, schools, children) to be appreciated anew. The book argues that cinema is the medium best placed to draw attention to this revaluation of the everyday, and particular films are presented as offering unique insights into the aesthetic nature of the educational concept. The book will be of primary interest to educators and educationalists alike, but its interdisciplinary nature should also appeal to those in the fields of film study, philosophy, and aesthetics.",N/A,N/A,en

It presents knowledge about how principles of problem-oriented, interdisciplinary and participant-directed project work may serve as a basis for planning and applying educational activities at institutions of higher learning. It discusses the dilemmas, problems, and diverging views that have challenged the model, provoking experiments and reforms that have helped develop practice without compromising the key principles. The Roskilde Model combines various student-centered learning concepts into a nexus, providing the foundation for a consistent pedagogical practice that is strongly supported by the educational structure and the academic profile of the university. A complex concept, the Roskilde Model refers to three different aspects: The first one is problem-oriented interdisciplinary and participant-directed project work (PPL). At Roskilde University, half of all study activities are organized in line with this particular pedagogical approach. The second aspect the model refers to is the organizing of university education on the basis of four interdisciplinary bachelor programmes. These programmes are part of the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and humanistic-technological sciences and give admission to two-year master programmes in a broad range of disciplines. The third aspect the model refers to is the interdisciplinary academic and educational profile of the university.",N/A,N/A,en

The 'resource' Approach to Mathematics Education,[],2019,['Mathematics'],"This edited volume will help educators better analyze methodological and practical tools designed to aid classroom instruction. It features papers that explore the need to create a system in order to fully meet the uncertainties and developments of modern educational phenomena. These have emerged due to the abundance of digital resources and new forms of collective work. The collected papers offer new perspectives to a rising field of research known as the Documentational Approach to Didactics. This framework was first created by the editors of this book. It seeks to develop a deeper understanding of mathematics teaching expertise. Readers will gain insight into how to meet the theoretical questions brought about by digitalization. These include: how to analyze teachers' work when they prepare for their teaching, how to conceptualize the relationships between individual and collective work, and how to follow the related processes over the long term. The contributors also provide a comparative view in terms of contrasting selected phenomena across different educational cultures and education systems. For instance, they consider how differences in curriculum resources are available to teachers and how teachers make use of them to shape instruction. Coverage also considers the extent to which teachers make use of additional material, particularly those available through the global marketplace on the Internet.

Conceptual Profiles,"['Eduardo F. Mortimer', 'Charbel N. El-Hani']",2014-02-20,['Science'],"The language of science has many words and phrases whose meaning either changes in differing contexts or alters to reflect developments in a given discipline. This book presents the authors’ theories on using ‘conceptual profiles’ to make the teaching of context-dependent meanings more effective. Developed over two decades, their theory begins with a recognition of the coexistence in the students’ discourse of those alternative meanings, even in the case of scientific concepts such as molecule, where the dissonance between the classical and modern views of the same phenomenon is an accepted norm. What began as an alternative model of conceptual change has evolved to incorporate a sociocultural approach, by drawing on ideas such as situated cognition and Vygotsky’s influential concept of culturally located learning. Also informed by pragmatist philosophy, the approach has grown into a well-rounded theory of teaching and learning scientific concepts. The authors have taken the opportunity in this book to develop their ideas further, anticipate and respond to criticisms—that of relativism, for example—and explain how their theory can be applied to analyze the teaching of core concepts in science such as heat and temperature, life and biological adaptation. They also report on the implementation of a research program that correlates the responsiveness of their methodology to all the main developments in the field of science education. This additional material will inform academic discussion, review, and further enhancement of their theory and research model.",N/A,N/A,en

Learning and Instructional Technologies for the 21st Century,"['Leslie Moller', 'Douglas M. Harvey']",2008-12-16,['Education'],"Learning and Instructional Technologies for the 21st Century gathers research which identify models and approaches to improve learning through the inclusion of technology. These papers, from leading researchers and thinkers in instructional technology, begin by refuting the idea that education can be improved through more or better technology. Instead, the contributors emphasize specific, research-based ideas, which re-evaluate learning, reorganize schools, redirect technology, and provide instruction. Acknowledging the critical role of technology, these contributions explore technology's main advantage--its ability to enable advanced learning designs and emerging paradigms as well as to evolve learning interactions. While each paper explores a specific aspect of the role of technology, the collection shares this common theme. Without sufficient consideration to the process of learning and its many facets, technological availability alone will not provide a sustained impact on the educational process. Originating from the first AECT Research Symposium, Learning and Instructional Technologies for the 21st Century will be of interest to researchers and practitioners alike.",N/A,N/A,en

Knowledge Management for School Education,['Cheng Eric C.K.'],2014-10-29,['Education'],"​This book introduces the application of knowledge management (KM) theories, practices, and tools in school organization for sustainable development. Schools in Asia Pacific have long faced a variety of challenges in terms of sustainable development under the education reforms and curriculum reforms to meet the demands of a knowledge society. Schools are inevitably expected to develop human capital for the knowledge society within the competitive global economy, and to interact with its policy environment and know how to leverage pedagogical knowledge. The high speed of expansion change and expansion of knowledge have dramatically influence the development of flexibility of teacher and school works. The nature of teacher work becomes increasingly less routine, more analytical, and disruptive yet often come with a sense of urgency and need to be more collaborative. Teachers not only require data and information, but also knowledge and experience of individual, they also need to collaborative task execution, decision making and problem solving. Helping school leaders and teachers to manage their knowledge and become “know how” to cope with the change is important.",N/A,N/A,en
Recovering Informal Learning,"['Paul Hager', 'John Halliday']",2008-10-14,['Education'],"Educational theory and practice have long been dominated by the requirements of formal learning. This book seeks to persuade readers through philosophical argument and empirical examples that the balance should shift back towards the informal. The arguments and examples derive from informal learning in diverse situations, such as leisure activities, as a preparation for and as part of work, and as a means of surviving undesirable circumstances like dead-end jobs and incarceration.",N/A,N/A,en
Flexible Scripting to Facilitate Knowledge Construction in Computer-supported Collaborative Learning,"['Xinghua Wang', 'Jin Mu']",2018-12-11,['Education'],"This book discusses the significance of flexible scripting to structure CSCL against the framework of “Script theory of guidance” and reports on findings from two empirical studies on the effects of flexible scripting on collaboration in CSCL scenarios. In the first empirical study flexibility was accomplished through adaptivity, and through adaptability in the second. The results of these studies show that adaptive and adaptable scripts enhanced the quality of collaborative knowledge construction processes as well as learners’ collaboration skills, compared to inflexible scripts. The findings presented in this book will contribute to theory building of the scripting approach in CSCL. The authors propose two innovative ways of achieving flexible scripting and address the mechanisms by which adaptive versus adaptable script influences collaborative knowledge construction. Moreover, the adaptive and adaptable scripting approaches provide hands-on examples for practitioners and contribute to their understanding of teaching design in CSCL settings.",N/A,N/A,en

Making Meaning,['Marilyn Narey'],2008-10-23,['Education'],"Making Meaning is a synthesis of theory, research, and practice that explicitly presents art as a meaning making process. This book provokes readers to examine their current understandings of language, literacy and learning through the lens of the various arts-based perspectives offered in this volume; provides a starting point for constructing broader, multimodal views of what it might mean to “make meaning”; and underscores why understanding arts-based learning as a meaning-making process is especially critical to early childhood education in the face of narrowly-focused, test-driven curricular reforms. Each contributor integrates this theory and research with stories of how passionate teachers, teacher-educators, and pre-service teachers, along with administrators, artists, and professionals from a variety of fields have transcended disciplinary boundaries to engage the arts as a meaning-making process for young children and for themselves.",N/A,N/A,en

Come ragionano i bambini,['Margaret Donaldson'],2009-10-09,['Psychology'],"Il libro Children’s Minds esce nel 1978. Con un linguaggio semplice, ma supportato da dati di ricerche condotte con rigore metodologico, Margaret Donaldson attacca molti luoghi comuni ispirati alle teorie di Piaget. Come sostiene l’autrice ""Nello svolgimento di questo libro, io sostengo che oggi esistono prove che ci costringono a respingere certi aspetti della teoria di Jean Piaget sullo sviluppo intellettuale"". Il libro fu quasi subito tradotto in italiano e pubblicato da EMME Edizioni, ma uscì dal commercio molto rapidamente e non fu ristampato. Su questo testo hanno lavorato molti ricercatori nei campi che vanno dalla psicologia cognitiva alla pedagogia alla didattica. Lo stile del libro e la sua scorrevolezza ne fanno in realtà una lettura adatta a un pubblico più vasto. In particolare sono molti gli stimoli e le indicazioni che un insegnante vi può trovare, anche se forse questo testo non ha influenzato tanto quanto avrebbe meritato i sistemi di convinzioni e le pratiche didattiche, almeno in Italia. Molti degli esempi discussi dalla Donaldson riguardano la costruzione dei primi significati matematici (la quantità, il coordinamento dei punti di vista, ecc.), o aspetti trasversali importanti per l’apprendimento della matematica, quali il ruolo del linguaggio e l’attività di soluzione di problemi. Per rendere più espliciti i riferimenti e le implicazioni per l’insegnamento della matematica il testo è accompagnato da una postfazione di Maria G. Bartolini Bussi e Rosetta Zan, che illustrano sia alcuni sviluppi successivi dei temi trattati che alcuni esempi di applicazioni a ricerche sperimentali in didattica della matematica.",N/A,N/A,it
Assessment in Science,['D.P. Shepardson'],2001-07-31,['Science'],"Assessment in Science combines professional development and classroom practice in a single volume. The pragmatic nature of the book makes it a valuable resource for administrators and staff developers interested in designing professional development programs, and for science teachers looking for techniques and examples of classroom-based assessments. Unique features of Assessment in Science include: 1) practical strategies and tools for implementing successful professional development programs in science assessment, 2) teacher stories and case studies about classroom-based assessment practice and how these teachers changed their assessment practice, 3) examples of classroom-based assessments and scoring guides, 4) samples of student work with teacher commentary, and 5) examples of how the national reform documents in science education served as tools in professional development programs and in designing classroom-based assessments. Assessment in Science expands the existing literature on science assessment by sharing a model for professional development, and examples of teacher-developed assessments with accompanying student work and teacher commentary. Chapters written by science teachers tell how they assess students and how they have changed their assessment practice, as well as how changing assessment practice has resulted in a change in their science instruction. Assessment in Science is targeted at practising professionals in science education: administrators, staff developers, science teachers, and university science educators. Assessment in Science has applicability to graduate-level courses in science education and in-service courses for science teachers. The teacher chapters are also appropriate for use in undergraduate science methods courses to illustrate classroom-based assessments.",N/A,N/A,en

Chemiedidaktik,['Hans-Dieter Barke'],2006-09-28,['Education'],"Bei Unterrichtsplanungen ging man noch vor einigen Jahrzehnten davon aus, dass die jungen Schüler und Schülerinnen kaum eigene Vorstellungen oder Kenntnisse in den naturwissenschaftlichen Unterricht mitbringen und deshalb eine gute Unterrichtsvorbereitung lediglich entscheiden müsse, in welcher Reihenfolge welche neuen Begriffe und Inhalte mit welchen Methoden, Medien und didaktischen Hilfsmitteln einzuführen seien. Fachdidaktische Erhebungen zeigen allerdings, dass sich Kinder und Jugendliche sehr wohl zu vielen Sachverhalten aus Natur und Alltag ihre eigenen Vorstellungen bilden. Um erfolgreiches Lernen zu ermöglichen oder wenigstens zu erleichtern, sollten Chemiedidaktiker und Chemielehrer ermitteln bzw. diagnostizieren, zu welchen Sachverhalten welche Erklärungen oder Vorstellungen vorliegen. Auf Grundlage dieser Kenntnisse sind Lehrer und Lehrerinnen dann besser in der Lage, eigene Tests oder Interviews zu entwerfen, um die spezifischen Fehlvorstellungen ihrer Schüler und Schülerinnen zu ermitteln, oder sie werden wenigstens stark sensibilisiert, im Unterrichtsgespräch mögliche Fehlvorstellungen zu erkennen. Sind die alternativen Vorstellungen der eigenen Schüler erkannt worden, gilt es zu entscheiden, in welcher Weise Korrekturen dieser Fehlvorstellungen vorzunehmen sind.

First, it begins with an outline of the field’s relevant historical, conceptual and theoretical backgrounds, what “discipline” means and how inter-, trans-, and meta-disciplinary activities can be understood. Relevant theoretical perspectives from Marx, Foucault and Vygotsky are explained, along with key ideas in theory, e.g. boundaries, discourses, identity, and the division of labour in practice. Second, the book reviews research findings of mainly empirical studies on interdisciplinary work involving mathematics in education, in all stages of education that have become disciplined. For example, it reports that a common theme in studies in middle and high schools is assessing the motivational benefits for the learner of subsuming disciplinary motives and even practices to extra-academic problem-solving activities; this is counter-balanced by the effort needed to overcome the disciplinary boundaries in academic institutions, and in professional identities. These disciplinary boundaries are less obviously limitations in middle and primary schools, and in some vocational courses. Third and finally, it explores selected case studies that illustrate these concepts and findings, both in terms of the motivational benefits for learners and the institutional and other boundaries involved.",N/A,N/A,en

"Interactions of Protons with Nuclei (Supplement to I/13a,b,c)",[],1994-01-25,['Science'],"The precise knowledge of production cross sections for specific radionuclides for medium energies (10 MeV to 100 GeV) of the incident particle gains ever more importance, not only for nuclear physics but also for many applications, e.g. astrophysics, radiation protection at accelerators but also on space flights, radioisotope techniques in medicine and for industrial applications and perhaps even for the removal of nuclear waste by accelerators. Since the last systematic review of these production cross sections in 1973 (LB I/5a, b, c) an impressive amount of new experimental data has been accumulated. In the first three parts of this volume already a huge amount of data has been compiled for the production of radioisotopes by medium energetic protons on targets from He to Am. The precise values of the cross sections can be taken from the tables, whereas the figures show the general trend of the cross sections and can be more readily used for interpolations. In the fourth part of this volume supplement data for subvolumes I/13a, b and c will be compiled. The origin of the authors made it possible to include also data from the USSR and other East European states which sometimes are not easy to access.

Out-of-field Teaching and Education Policy,['Anna Elizabeth Du Plessis'],2020,['Education and state'],"This book focuses on the elusive out-of-field teaching phenomenon and its direct effects on quality education globally. Based on the experiences and concerns of teachers and school leaders, it investigates the phenomenon's impact on everyday teaching and school practices, and offers insights into the challenges that out-of-field teachers face in maintaining their role as the ""knowledgeable counterpart"" in their teaching and learning environments. In this frame, it also highlights the often-overlooked importance of initial teacher education and its preparation of prospective teachers for employment in complex school contexts, subjects or year levels. The book emphasises the need to develop specific policy strategies to effectively address the global implications of out-of-field teaching, and explores the potential of micro-education policies as targeted support resources for teachers in these challenging positions. Through this new policy lens, which renegotiates the discourse of education policy as a quality education improvement framework, the book offers readers a comprehensive understanding of the urgent need for policy to uphold all stakeholders involved in these unique and complex environments. Accordingly, the book is a valuable resource for academic advisors, decision-makers, policy-makers, and educational and school leaders in developing new approaches to improving school outcomes that promote the retention of teachers for a strong and stable teaching workforce.",N/A,N/A,en

Towards a Philosophy of Caring in Higher Education,['Yusef Waghid'],2019,['Education'],"This book advances a re-imagined view of caring in higher education. The author proposes an argument of rhythmic caring, whereby teachers hold back or release their judgments in such a way that students' judgments are influenced accordingly. In doing so, the author argues that rhythmic caring encourages students to become more willing and confident in articulating their understandings, judgments and opinions, rather than being prematurely judged and prevented from re-articulating themselves. Thus, rhythmic caring can engender a different understanding of higher education: one that is connected to the cultivation of values such as autonomy, justice, empathy, mutual respect and Ubuntu (human dignity and interdependence). This book will be of interest and value to students and scholars of caring within education, as well as Ubuntu caring through the African context.",N/A,N/A,en

How To Interpret The Growing Phenomenon Of Private Tutoring,['Hai-Anh Dang'],2008,['Academic achievement'],"Private tutoring is now a major component of the education sector in many developing countries, yet education policy too seldom acknowledges and makes use of it. Various criticisms have been raised against private tutoring, most notably that it exacerbates social inequalities and may even fail to improve student outcomes. This paper surveys the literature for evidence on private tutoring-the extent of the tutoring phenomenon, the factors that explain its growth, and its cost-effectiveness in improving student academic performance. It also presents a framework for assessing the efficiency and equity effects of tutoring. It concludes that tutoring can raise the effectiveness of the education system under certain reasonable assumptions, even taking into account equity concerns, and it offers guidance for attacking corruption and other problems that diminish the contributions of the tutoring sector.",N/A,N/A,en

Preventing Fatal Incidents in School and Youth Group Camps and Excursions,['Andrew Brookes'],2018-06-12,['Education'],"This book approaches the prevention of fatal incidents in outdoor education and related fields through detailed study of past tragedies. Although safety in many fields is built on accumulated lessons from past incidents, tragedies on school or youth group camps and excursions are so infrequent and so widely scattered that knowledge from previous incidents can elude those who would benefit. Nevertheless, the emergence of unlearned lessons from the past weighs heavily when those affected by a tragedy judge whether an incident should have been prevented. This book provides a foundation for a detailed and comprehensive understanding of fatality prevention in outdoor education, and in youth camps and excursions. It compiles, examines, and analyses information on fatal incidents that have occurred over many decades, involving many kinds of groups and endeavours, from around the globe. No previous work has attempted this task.",N/A,N/A,en

Adoption of Data Analytics in Higher Education Learning and Teching,"['Dirk Ifenthaler', 'David Gibson']",2020,['Educational technology'],"The book aims to advance global knowledge and practice in applying data science to transform higher education learning and teaching to improve personalization, access and effectiveness of education for all. Currently, higher education institutions and involved stakeholders can derive multiple benefits from educational data mining and learning analytics by using different data analytics strategies to produce summative, real-time, and predictive or prescriptive insights and recommendations. Educational data mining refers to the process of extracting useful information out of a large collection of complex educational datasets while learning analytics emphasizes insights and responses to real-time learning processes based on educational information from digital learning environments, administrative systems, and social platforms. This volume provides insight into the emerging paradigms, frameworks, methods and processes of managing change to better facilitate organizational transformation toward implementation of educational data mining and learning analytics. It features current research exploring the (a) theoretical foundation and empirical evidence of the adoption of learning analytics, (b) technological infrastructure and staff capabilities required, as well as (c) case studies that describe current practices and experiences in the use of data analytics in higher education.",N/A,N/A,en

Mathematical Modelling Courses for Engineering Education,"['Yasar Ersoy', 'Alfredo O. Moscardini']",1994-10-27,['Computers'],"As the role of the modern engineer is markedly different from that of even a decade ago, the theme of engineering mathematics educa tion (EME) is an important one. The need for mathematical model ling (MM) courses and consideration of the educational impact of computer-based technology environments merit special attention. This book contains the proceeding of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop held on this theme in July 1993. We have left the industrial age behind and have entered the in formation age. Computers and other emerging technologies are penetrating society in depth and gaining a strong influence in de termining how in future society will be organised, while the rapid change of information requires a more qualified work force. This work force is vital to high technology and economic competitive ness in many industrialised countries throughout the world. Within this framework, the quality of EME has become an issue. It is expected that the content of mathematics courses taught in schools of engineering today have to be re-evaluated continuously with regard to computer-based technology and the needs of mod ern information society. The main aim of the workshop was to pro vide a forum for discussion between mathematicians, engineering scientists, mathematics educationalists, and courseware develop ers in the higher education sector and to focus on the issues and problems of the design of more relevant and appropriate MM courses for engineering education.",N/A,N/A,en

Mentoring and Diversity,['Thomas Landefeld'],2009-10-21,['Science'],"Mentoring has always been an important factor in life and particularly in academia. In fact, making choices about educational pursuits and subsequent careers without input from mentors can prove disastrous. Fortunately, many individuals have “na- ral” mentors and for them these choices are greatly facilitated. Others are not pri- leged with natural mentors and as such often struggle with making these tough choices. Many times these individuals are from under served and disadvantaged backgrounds, where mentors are too few and far between. For them, deciding on which career path to take can be based not only on insufficient information but oft times on inaccurate information. Although the tips in this monograph are designed for helping all individuals who are interested in pursuing the study of science and science careers, a special mentoring focus is on those students who have not expe- enced the advantages of the privileged class. Additionally, tips are included for those who are interested in effectively mentoring these individuals. How and why a person gets to that point of wanting to mentor is not as important as the fact that they have made that commitment and this monograph will help them do exactly that. When I received my PhD in Reproductive Endocrinology from the University of Wisconsin, I was ready and anxious to discover all kinds of new and exciting aspects about this field of science.",N/A,N/A,en

Multilingual Education Yearbook 2019,"['Indika Liyanage', 'Tony Walker']",2019,['Language and education'],"This book offers essential insights into the challenges and complexities surrounding the medium of instruction (MOI), its impact on all languages and stakeholders in multilingual contexts, educational processes, developments and outcomes. MOI has been a prominent topic in recent debates on the role of languages in education in multilingual contexts, partly because prioritizing one language over others as the medium of instruction has a profound impact on all languages and stakeholders in multilingual contexts. These include, to name but a few, (language) teachers, teacher educators, students, and policymakers, as well as industries and enterprises built around the needs and expectations of these stakeholders. This book presents high-quality empirical research on education in multilingual societies. It highlights research findings that, in addition to providing descriptions of language learning, development and use in language contact and multilingual contexts, will help shape future language education policy and practices in multilingual societies.",N/A,N/A,en

Teaching Struggling Students,['Laura M. Harrison'],2019,"['Education, Higher']","""Within this book, Harrison gives us a unique gift. By looking from the inside outward, and placing herself in a student-researcher-faculty member liminal space, she offers an empathic, self-aware, and smart autoethnographic telling of what it is like to struggle inside the college classroom. I highly recommend this work to anyone in a position to support today's college students.""--Amanda O. Latz, Associate Professor, Ball State University, USA ""As a college classroom teacher for more than two decades, I found Harrison's exploration of the complex pedagogical space between professor and student immensely illuminating. Her auto-ethnographic journey both elucidates important barriers to student learning (e.g., expert blind spots; the limits of grit) and provides practical strategies for more empathically teaching struggling students. Reminiscent of Parker Palmer, Harrison also challenges us to reflexively engage our students and to eschew the siren call of instructional training and efficiency-limited technology to employ a deeply human, self-reflective and relational form of pedagogy."" -Tracy Davis, Professor of Higher Education and Student Affairs, Western Illinois University, USA This book tackles the phenomenon of limited learning on campuses by approaching it from the point of view of the author, an educator who writes about the experience of being, simultaneously, a college student and a college professor. The author lays out her experience as a student struggling in an introductory linguistics class, framing her struggles as sites ripe for autoethnographic interrogation. Throughout the book, the author melds her personal narratives with the extant research on college student learning, college readiness, and the interconnectedness of affect, intellect, and socio-cultural contexts. This book poses a challenge to the current binary metanarrative that circles the college student learning conundrum, which highlights either the faculty or student perspective, and unfolds this unnecessary binary into a rich, nuanced, and polyvocal set of perspectives.",N/A,N/A,en
A Technical Manual for Parasitic Weed Research and Extension,['J. Kroschel'],2001-07-31,['Technology & Engineering'],"Parasitic weeds of the families Cuscutaceae, Orobanchaceae and Scrophulariaceae are considered to be among the major problems facing agriculture in the Tropics and Subtropics. In the last decades, enormous efforts have been made and success achieved by scientists all over the world in gaining a better understanding of their biology and ecology as well as of control methods. However, no substantial reduction of infestation has been achieved in the past and control strategies specific to the different parasites, crops and farming systems must be further developed or adapted and realised among a wider farming population with suitable extension methods. This `Technical Manual' provides up-to-date methodologies for various aspects of research and extension related to parasitic weed species of the genera Striga, Alectra, Orobanche and Cuscuta. It has the intention to support scientists and extension workers of international and national research and extension institutes and universities, who are either new to the subject or plan to apply further techniques they are not yet familiar with.",N/A,N/A,en
