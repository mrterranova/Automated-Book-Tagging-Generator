American Judaism,['Nathan Glazer'],1957,['History'],"First published in 1957, Nathan Glazer's classic, historical study of Judaism in America has been described by the New York Times Book Review as ""a remarkable story . . . told briefly and clearly by an objective historical mind, yet with a fine combination of sociological insight and religious sensitivity."" Glazer's new introduction describes the drift away from the popular equation of American Judaism with liberalism during the last two decades and considers the threat of divisiveness within American Judaism. Glazer also discusses tensions between American Judaism and Israel as a result of a revivified Orthodoxy and the disillusionment with liberalism.

The Oxford Handbook of Apocalyptic Literature,['John Joseph Collins'],2014,['Literary Criticism'],"Apocalypticism arose in ancient Judaism in the last centuries BCE and played a crucial role in the rise of Christianity. It is not only of historical interest: there has been a growing awareness, especially since the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, of the prevalence of apocalyptic beliefs in the contemporary world. To understand these beliefs, it is necessary to appreciate their complex roots in the ancient world, and the multi-faceted character of the phenomenon of apocalypticism. The Oxford Handbook of Apocalyptic Literature is a thematic and phenomenological exploration of apocalypticism in the Judaic and Christian traditions. Most of the volume is devoted to the apocalyptic literature of antiquity. Essays explore the relationship between apocalypticism and prophecy, wisdom and mysticism; the social function of apocalypticism and its role as resistance literature; apocalyptic rhetoric from both historical and postmodern perspectives; and apocalyptic theology, focusing on phenomena of determinism and dualism and exploring apocalyptic theology's role in ancient Judaism, early Christianity, and Gnosticism. The final chapters of the volume are devoted to the appropriation of apocalypticism in the modern world, reviewing the role of apocalypticism in contemporary Judaism and Christianity, and more broadly in popular culture, addressing the increasingly studied relation between apocalypticism and violence, and discussing the relationship between apocalypticism and trauma, which speaks to the underlying causes of the popularity of apocalyptic beliefs. This volume will further the understanding of a vital religious phenomenon too often dismissed as alien and irrational by secular western society.",N/A,N/A,en
A History of Zionism,['Walter Laqueur'],1972,['History'],"Examines the development of Zionist thought, and its inherent link with the growth of antisemitism in the 19th century. Argues that while there were clearly other factors, antisemitism was a major element in the emergence of Zionism. Discusses the Zionist view of antisemitism as the result of the Jews' anomolous social and economic structure in the diaspora. Notes the growth of Zionist youth movements in Germany as a reaction to antisemitic movements. Points out that the lack of help given to Jews during the Holocaust gave Zionism a great impetus at the end of the Second World War. However, it was also felt that the idea of a Jewish state had lost its ""raison d'etre"" as a haven for persecuted European Jews. Zionist leaders had anticipated persecutions and expulsions, but not mass murder as a solution to the ""Jewish problem."" Discusses theories on antisemitism of major Zionist thinkers: Moses Hess, Max Lilienblum, Leo Pinsker, Max Nordau, Chaim Weizmann, and Ze'ev Jabotinsky.",N/A,N/A,en
Blood and Belief,['David Biale'],2007,['History'],"""A wonderful, rich, and fascinating book, and a great read. Biale explores the meanings of blood within Jewish and Christian cultures from the blood of the sacrifices of the book of Leviticus to the blood of the Eucharist to the blood of medieval blood libels and the place of blood in Nazi ideology. Biale shows that blood symbolism stands at the center of the divide between Judaism and Christianity. This book will be the point of departure for all future studies of the subject.""—Shaye J.D. Cohen, Harvard University ""I know of no other work that, through numerous insights and useful distinctions, so alerts us to and comprehensively documents the ongoing constitutive role of Christian and anti-Semitic perceptions of Jewish existence and the interactions between them. Whereas much contemporary historiography has become so specialized that historians have surrendered the larger picture, David Biale's panoramic perspective reveals the great value and interest of this work.""—Steven E.

The Religion of Israel,['Robert L. Ottley'],1905,['Judaism'],N/A,N/A,N/A,en
From Text to Tradition,['Lawrence H. Schiffman'],1991,['Religion'],"From Text to Tradition examines the history of Judaism as it developed from the religion of biblical Israel to the Judaism of the talmudic rabbis. Each step in this process is discussed from the historical, literary and religious points of view and the context of the political history of the Jews. Among the topics covered in this connection are the biblical heritage which underlies all later Judaism, the importance of the Persian period for laying the groundwork for postbiblical Judaism, the confrontation of Judaism with Hellenism, apocrypha, pseudepigrapha and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Pharisees, Sadducees and Essenes, the Jewish-Christian schism, the impact of the Jewish revolts against Rome and the destruction of the Temple, the rise of Rabbinic Judaism, and the development of the Mishnah, Talmud and Jewish law. One of the books major theses is that the various approaches to Judaism shared sufficient common ground as to be classified as one, albeit variegated, religious tradition. Diverging trends may be--and are--traced during this period, as is the question of the role of interpretation, the impact of external influences, and the process by which the competing approaches were eventually supplanted by the rabbinic tradition, which became the basis for medieval and modern Judaism. In this way, Judaism is shown to have travelled the long road from the textual heritage of the Hebrew Bible to the oral tradition of the rabbis.",N/A,N/A,en

Apocalypse Against Empire,['Anathea Portier-Young'],2011-01-06,['History'],"A fresh and daring take on ancient apocalyptic books. The year 167 b.c.e. marked the beginning of a period of intense persecution for the people of Judea, as Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes attempted forcibly and brutally to eradicate traditional Jewish religious practices. In Apocalypse against Empire Anathea Portier-Young reconstructs the historical events and key players in this traumatic episode in Jewish history and provides a sophisticated treatment of resistance in early Judaism. Building on a solid contextual foundation, Portier-Young argues that the first Jewish apocalypses emerged as a literature of resistance to Hellenistic imperial rule. She makes a sturdy case for this argument by examining three extant apocalypses, giving careful attention to the interplay between social theory, history, textual studies, and theological analysis. In particular, Portier-Young contends, the book of Daniel, the Apocalypse of Weeks, and the Book of Dreams were written to supply an oppressed people with a potent antidote to the destructive propaganda of the empire renewing their faith in the God of the covenant and answering state terror with radical visions of hope..",N/A,N/A,en

The Proof of the Gospel,"['Eusebius (of Caesarea, Bishop of Caesarea)']",1981,['Religion'],"""Eusebius wrote The Proof of the Gospel for those who have passed beyond the need of elementary instruction in Christianity and are ""already in a state prepared for the reception of the higher truths."" He intended to ""convey the exact knowledge of the most stringent proofs of God's mysterious dispensation in regard to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."" Only ten of the original twenty books comprising this work have survived. Books 1 and 2 are introductory. Book 3 treats Christ's humanity and is perhaps the most modern part of the argument. By an elaborate reductio ad absurdum, Eusebius shows dramatically and cogently the impossibility of Jesus Christ being anything but perfect man and divine. ... Books 4 and 5 deal with Christ's divinity, and it is in them that passages of an Arian ring appear. Books 6-9 discuss the Jesus' incarnate life as the fulfillment of prophecy.

Coming to Terms with America,['Jonathan D. Sarna'],2021-09,['History'],"Coming to Terms with America examines how Jews have long “straddled two civilizations,” endeavoring to be both Jewish and American at once, from the American Revolution to today. In fifteen engaging essays, Jonathan D. Sarna investigates the many facets of the Jewish-American encounter—what Jews have borrowed from their surroundings, what they have resisted, what they have synthesized, and what they have subverted. Part I surveys how Jews first worked to reconcile Judaism with the country’s new democratic ethos and to reconcile their faith-based culture with local metropolitan cultures. Part II analyzes religio-cultural initiatives, many spearheaded by women, and the ongoing tensions between Jewish scholars (who pore over traditional Jewish sources) and activists (who are concerned with applying them). Part III appraises Jewish-Christian relations: “collisions” within the public square and over church-state separation. Originally written over the span of forty years, many of these essays are considered classics in the field, and several remain fixtures of American Jewish history syllabi. Others appeared in fairly obscure venues and will be discovered here anew. Together, these essays—newly updated for this volume—cull the finest thinking of one of American Jewry’s finest historians.",N/A,N/A,en

Augustine and the Jews,['Paula Fredriksen'],2010-10-12,['Religion'],"Now in paperback with a new postscript, this updated edition of Paula Fredriksen’s critically acclaimed Augustine and the Jews traces the social and intellectual forces that led to the development of Christian anti-Judaism and shows how and why Augustine challenged this tradition. Drawing us into the life, times, and thought of Augustine of Hippo (396–430), Fredriksen focuses on the period of astounding creativity that led to his new understanding of Paul and to his great classic, The Confessions. She shows how Augustine’s struggle to read the Bible led him to a new theological vision, one that countered the anti-Judaism not only of his Manichaean opponents but also of his own church. The Christian Empire, Augustine held, was right to ban paganism and to coerce heretics. But the source of ancient Jewish scripture and current Jewish practice, he argued, was the very same as that of the New Testament and of the church—namely, God himself. Accordingly, he urged, Jews were to be left alone. Conceived as a vividly original way to defend Christian ideas about Jesus and about the Old Testament, Augustine’s theological innovation survived the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, and it ultimately served to protect Jewish lives against the brutality of medieval crusades. Augustine and the Jews sheds new light on the origins of Christian anti-Semitism and, through Augustine, opens a path toward better understanding between two of the world’s great religions.",N/A,N/A,en

The Pope at War,['David I. Kertzer'],2022,['History'],"Filled with discoveries, this is the dramatic story of Pope Pius XII's struggle to respond to the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the Nazi domination of Europe. The Pope at War is the third in a trilogy of books about the papacy's response to the rise of Fascism and Nazism. It tells the dramatic story of Pope Pius XII's struggle to respond to the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the ongoing Nazi attempts to exterminate the Jews of Europe. It is the first book dealing with the war to make extensive use of the newly opened Vatican archives for the war years. It is based, as well, on thousands of documents from the Italian, German, French, British, and American archives. Among the many new discoveries brought to light is the discovery that within weeks of becoming pope in 1939, Pius XII entered into secret negotiations with Hitler through Hitler's emissary, a Nazi Prince who was married to the daughter of the King of Italy and who was very close to Hitler. The negotiations were kept so secret that not even the German ambassador to the Holy See was informed of them. The book also offers new insight into the thinking behind Pius XII's decision to maintain good relations with the German government during the war, including keeping the Germans happy while they occupied Rome in 1943-1944. And throughout, David I. Kertzer shows the active role of the Italian Church hierarchy in promoting the Axis war while the pope, who as bishop of Rome was responsible for the Italian hierarchy, offered his silent blessings and cast his public speeches in such a way that both sides could claim support for their cause.",N/A,N/A,en

Maimonides,['Sherwin B. Nuland'],2005,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Part of the Jewish Encounter series Moses Maimonides was a Renaissance man before there was a Renaissance: a great physician who served a sultan, a dazzling Torah scholar, a community leader, a daring philosopher whose greatest work—The Guide for the Perplexed—attempted to reconcile scientific knowledge with faith in God. He was a Jew living in a Muslim world, a rationalist living in a time of superstition. Eight hundred years after his death, his notions about God, faith, the afterlife, and the Messiah still stir debate; his life as a physician still inspires; and the enigmas of his character still fascinate. Sherwin B. Nuland—best-selling author ofHow We Die—focuses his surgeon’s eye and writer’s pen on this greatest of rabbis, most intriguing of Jewish philosophers, and most honored of Jewish doctors. He gives us a portrait of Maimonides that makes his life, his times, and his thought accessible to the general reader as they have never been before.",N/A,N/A,en

The Sabbath in the Classical Kabbalah,"['Elliot Kiba Ginsburg', 'Associate Professor of Jewish Thought Department of Near Eastern Studies Elliot K Ginsburg']",1989-01-01,['Religion'],"This book is a critical study of the mystical celebration of Sabbath in the classical period of Kabbalah, from the late twelfth to the early sixteenth centuries. The Kabbalists' re-reading of the earlier Jewish tradition has been called a model of ""mythopoeic revision,"" a revision rooted in a world-view that stressed the interrelation of all worlds and levels of being. This is the first work, in any language, to systematically collect and analyze all the major innovations in praxis and theology that classical Kabbalah effected upon the development of the Rabbinic Sabbath, one of the most central areas of Jewish religious practice. The author analyzes the historical development of the Kabbalistic Sabbath, constructs a theoretical framework for the interpretation of its dense myth-ritual structure, and provides a phenomenology of key myths and rituals. It is one of the first Kabbalistic studies to integrate traditional textual-historical scholarship with newer methods employed in the study of religion and symbolic anthropology.",N/A,N/A,en
Jews of a Saharan Oasis,['John O. Hunwick'],2006,['History'],"Jews spread out from Israel into northern Africa after the Roman destruction of much of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. and settled in Saharan oases. Although there was no love for Jews after the birth of Islam five centuries later, Muslim Arabs accepted Jews' right to retain their own religion in lands they occupied, and so violence against them was quite rare. That enabled many Jews to remain in North Africa after Arab conquest of the region. However, after Jews living in Tlemcen [Algeria], or in the oasis of Touat became involved in trans-Saharan trade, even with Muslims, strong opposition to them occurred. Tlemcen, seen by Jews as 'Jerusalem of the West, ' was primarily Muslim occupied, and for economic reasons, the Jews living there became greatly disliked on account of their trans-Saharan trading - mainly for gold. A Tlemcen scholar, Muhammad al-Maghili, spent time in Touat, and used Islam-based arguments to destroy their synagogue there and expel them. He also got Jews excluded from the Songhay Empire. This book examines the whole process, with translations of Arabic Islamic writings on Jews and their rights to pursue their religion",N/A,N/A,en

In addition the collection provides illuminating social, cultural, and anthropological explanations for the prominence of the magical in certain periods and literatures.",N/A,N/A,en

Our Father Abraham,['Marvin R Wilson'],2021-06-29,[],"Although the roots of Christianity run deep into Hebrew soil, many Christians remain regrettably uninformed about the rich Jewish heritage of the church. Our Father Abraham delineates the vital link between Judaism and Christianity, exemplified by the common ancestry of the two faiths traceable back to Abraham. Marvin Wilson calls Christians to reexamine their Semitic heritage to regain a more authentically biblical understanding of what they believe and practice. Wilson, a trusted voice among both Jews and Christians, speaks to both past and present, first developing a historical perspective on the Jewish origins of the church and then discussing how the church can become more attuned to the Hebraic mindset of Scripture. Drawing from his own extensive experience, he also offers valuable practical guidance for salutary interaction between Christians and Jews. Discussion questions at the end of each chapter make this book especially suitable for use in groups--Christian, Jewish, or interfaith--as readers strive to make sense of their own faith in connection with the other. The second edition of Our Father Abraham features a new preface, an expanded bibliography of recent relevant works, and two new chapters: one that discusses Jewish-Christian relations after the Holocaust and another that reflects on Wilson's own fifty-plus-year career as an evangelical Christian deeply committed to interfaith dialogue. As Christians and Jews feel a growing need for mutual support in an increasingly secular Western world, Wilson's widely acclaimed book will offer encouragement and wise guidance toward this worthy end.",N/A,N/A,en

The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,['Sergi︠e︡ĭ Nilusʺ'],2014,['Anti-Jewish propaganda'],"The Protocols of the (Learned) Elders of Zion is one of the most controversial books ever written. Since its publication this small book has aroused great controversy and bitter debate. It is a source of acrimony and vituperation because of its contents and its supposed authors and because it purports to describe an ancient and enduring agenda for World Empire. Moreover, the ""unknown authors"" of the Protocols leave no doubt in mind of the reader of their great misanthropy and hatred for the ordinary man and a rancorous enmity for God and Christ. Furthermore, that the supposed authors affect to be Jews leads the unwary reader to conclude that the Protocols are indeed a Jewish design for World Empire and so illustrates superbly the secret rancour of the Jew for the Gentile and his nations. But gentle reader, those who understand such things conclude otherwise. That there is an ancient and enduring rancour for the Gentile by certain Jews there is no doubt. Similarly, that certain Jews have always and still do work to establish Jewish hegemony over the world is not doubted by informed researchers. But what is usually not understood is that Organised Jewry -the leadership of this Jewish ambition- has been in the thrall of a small cabal of men who have for many generations used the race of Jews for a far more sinister aim than merely the establishment of a One World Government under Jewry.",N/A,N/A,en

Women and Judaism,['Roslyn Lacks'],1980,['Religion'],"Lacks analyzes the historical, cultural, and mythological sources for women's status in Judaism and Western society. Moving from the earliest pre-biblical civilizations to the present, she explores the evolution of the roles of Jewish women and what they mean today. Tracing the transformation of woman's image through time, Lacks examines the shift from polytheism to patriarchal culture in the ancient Near East and shows how early Jewish views of women derived from older mythologies. She reassesses the leading female figures of the Bible in light of this influence, emphasizing the complex and often misunderstood dimensions of these key archetypes. Most important, Lacks argues that the most confining and unrealistic strictures on the role of women in Judaism arose from the subtle and selective misreading of canonical texts throughout the later history of Jewish scholarship. Lacks also reviews the great protagonists in the struggle for female equality in Judaism-from the learned Talmudic scholar Beruriah to the heroic women of the present century who have fought for and in some cases won the official right to serve as rabbis in Jewish congregations all over the world. --From publisher description.",N/A,N/A,en

Modern Judaism,['John Allen'],1816,['Religion'],"John Allen's discussion of Judaism dates to 1816; for many years, it was the authoritative history of the Jews from the time of Abraham through to the modern day. When sourcing the information necessary for this account, the author was discerning and meticulous: the history of the Jews is a topic of enormous depth and scope, requiring the use of holy books and written records often centuries or millennia old. Principally he examines the Holy Bible, and in particular the pertinent Old Testament texts, plus the holy books of the Jews such as the Kabbalah and Talmud. Other more esoteric sources include the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' Prayer Book. Each chapter of Modern Judaism includes numerous notes, elaborating further and list the relevant passages. Many wide-ranging aspects of Jewish life are covered; such as how to manage births, marriages, deaths, the preparation of food and the care of pregnant women. The ancient temple and its precepts are extensively narrated, that readers comprehend how the Jewish faith changed and evolved as the centuries passed, with rabbis across the ages contributing to the written lore. This reprint reproduces the tables and Hebrew script of the expanded second edition, which was first published in 1830.",N/A,N/A,en

Beyond Reasonable Doubt,['Louis Jacobs'],1999,['Religion'],"More than forty years have passed since Louis Jacobs first put forward the argument that traditionally observant Jews have no reason to take issue with the results obtained by the historical critics in their investigation into the Bible and the other classical sources of Judaism. As a result of his views, which were first published in the still-controversial text We Have Reason to Believe, the Anglo-Jewish Orthodox hierarchy banned Jacobs from serving as an Orthodox rabbi. In this new book, Louis Jacobs examines afresh all the issues involved. He does so objectively but with passion, meeting the objections put forward by critics from the various trends within the Jewish world, both Orthodox and Reform. In a recent poll conducted by the (London) Jewish Chronicle, Louis Jacobs was chosen as the 'Greatest British Jew.'",N/A,N/A,en
"The Jews of Medieval Western Christendom, 1000-1500",['Robert Chazan'],2006,['History'],"""Between the years AD 1000 and 1500, western Christendom absorbed by conquest and attracted through immigration a growing number of Jews. This community was to make a valuable contribution to rapidly developing European civilisation but was also to suffer some terrible setbacks, culminating in a series of expulsions from the more advanced westerly areas of Europe. At the same time, vigorous new branches of world Jewry emerged and a rich new Jewish cultural legacy was created. In this important new historical synthesis, Robert Chazan discusses the Jewish experience over a 500 year period across the entire continent of Europe. As well as being the story of medieval Jewry, the book simultaneously illuminates important aspects of majority life in Europe during this period. This book is essential reading for all students of medieval Jewish history and an important reference for any scholar of medieval Europe."" http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0729/2007296937-d.html.",N/A,N/A,en

Between Rome and Babylon,"[""A'haron Oppenheimer"", 'Aharon Oppenheimer']",2005,['History'],"Between Rome and Babylon includes over thirty papers by Aharon Oppenheimer about Jewish life in Palestine and Babylonia in the period of the Mishnah and the Talmud (1st-4th centuries), dealing with leadership and society, political and military activity, relations with the authorities and historical geography. The collection is organized around three inter-connected themes: 1 Roman Palestine and its Environs; 2 The Bar Kokhba Revolt; 3 Babylonia Judaica. About two-thirds of the papers were originally published in Hebrew. They have been selected and edited for this collection, and translated for the first time into English or German. The rest of the papers originally appeared in various different languages and contexts, and they too have been selected and edited to fit the three themes. Cross-references have been added, as well as detailed indices.The aim of the papers is to cast light on Jewish history by extracting methodically historical meaning from Talmudic sources, taking into account when they were written, where they were edited, and how far they can be presumed authentic; and by looking at them in combination with Greek, Roman, Persian and Arabic written sources as well as relevant archaeological finds.",N/A,N/A,de
In Ishmael's House,['Martin Gilbert'],2010,['HISTORY'],"This work reflects upon the historical relationship between Jews and Muslims in the Middle East, from the origins to the present day, exploring the impact of Zionism, clashing nationalisms, and the Six-Day War. The relationship between Jews and Muslims has been a flashpoint that affects stability in the Middle East and has consequences around the globe. In this book the author challenges the standard media portrayal and presents a fascinating account of hope, opportunity, fear, and terror that have characterized these two peoples through the 1,400 years of their intertwined history. Harking back to the Biblical story of Ishmael and Isaac, he takes the reader from the origins of the fraught relationship, the refusal of Medina's Jews to accept Mohammed as a prophet, through the ages of the Crusader reconquest of the Holy Land and the great Muslim sultanates to the present day. He explores the impact of Zionism in the first half of the twentieth century, the clash of nationalisms during the Second World War, the mass expulsions and exodus of 800,000 Jews from Muslim lands following the birth of Israel, the Six-Day War and its aftermath, and the political sensitivities of the current Middle East. This book sheds light on a time of prosperity and opportunity for Jews in Muslim lands stretching from Morocco to Afghanistan, with many instances of Muslim openness, support, and courage. Drawing on Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sources, the author uses archived material, poems, letters, memoirs, and personal testimony to uncover the human voice of this centuries-old conflict. Ultimately this account of mutual tolerance between Muslims and Jews provides a perspective on current events and a template for the future.",N/A,N/A,en

Integrating Women Into Second Temple History,['Ṭal Ilan'],1999,['History'],"Most studies about women, Jewish and other, are usually confined to the domestic sphere: the home, the family, the bed. Yet women were present at all historical events, and it is not only their presence but also their significance for these events which should be recognized. All the sources seem to militate against an approach which assumes the presence of women at public events. When dealing with politics, war and religion they ignore women; when dealing with women, they confine themselves to their prescribed region of the home.In this book Tal Ilan seeks to discover women in public places and at the main events of Second Temple Judaism. The primary principle guiding her work is that if by chance women are mentioned in sources, they should not be treated as a means for explaining the event but rather as an end in themselves. Thus sources showing women as remote or obscure turn out to yield much relevant material.Tal Ilan investigates women's association with the Pharisees and other sects, and analyses women's role in the writings of Josephus, Ben Sira and other important sources. Furthermore she presents us with new insights into famous women: Shelamzion Alexandra, Beruriah, Berenice and others. Special space is devoted to the importance of the Judaean Desert Documents for women's history.",N/A,N/A,en
And from There You Shall Seek,['Joseph Dov Soloveitchik'],2008,['Religion'],"""The present volume is a translation of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik's classic essay, ""U-Vikkashtem mi-Sham."" Drafted in the 1940's as a companion to his earlier treatise Halakhic Man, this powerful and wide-ranging work was published in Hebrew only in 1978. Drawing its title from Deuteronomy 4:29 - ""And from there you shall seek the Lord your God, and you shall find Him if you search for Him with all of your heart and all of your soul"" - and framed by the evocative metaphors of the Song of Songs, the essay charts the individual's search for God, a quest which culminates in the stage of devekut, cleaving to Him."" ""The human being initially seeks God by examining the natural and spiritual worlds. But this search fails; hence God must reveal Himself and express His will. Rabbi Soloveitchik explicates the contrast between these two different modes of experiencing the divine: the natural consciousness, marked by freedom and creativity, and the revelational consciousness, marked by compulsion and discipline. The remainder of the work elaborates on this dialectic, exploring such themes as the imitation of God, devekut, mercy and justice, trust and fear, love and awe, the rule of intellect, elevation of the body, the perpetuity of God's word, and creation and revelation."" ""And From There You Shall Seek is Rabbi Soloveitchik's fullest and most elaborate examination of religious consciousness and the dynamics of religious experience. Its presentation of the challenging interplay between cultural creativity, religious practice, and spiritual quest is sure to enrich the contemporary reader."" --Book Jacket.",N/A,N/A,en
