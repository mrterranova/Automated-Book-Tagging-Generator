Writings in General Linguistics,['Ferdinand de Saussure'],2006,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique générale was posthumously composed by his students from the notes they had made at his lectures. The book became one of the most influential works of the twentieth century, giving direction to modern linguistics and inspiration to literary and cultural theory. Before he died Saussure told friends he was writing up the lectures himself but no evidence of this was found. Eighty years later in 1996 a manuscript in Saussure's hand was discovered in the orangerie of his family house in Geneva. This proved to be the missing original of the great work. It is published now in English for the first time in an edition edited by Simon Bouquet and Rudolf Engler, and translated and introduced by Carol Sanders and Matthew Pires, all leading Saussure scholars. The book includes an earlier discovered manuscript on the philosophy of language, Saussure's own notes for lectures, and a comprehensive bibliography of major work on Saussure from 1970 to 2004. It is remarkable that for eighty years the understanding of Saussure's thought has depended on an incomplete and non-definitive text, the sometimes aphoristic formulations of which gave rise to many creative interpretations and arguments for and against Saussure. Did he, or did he not, see language as a-social and a-historical? Did he, or did he not, rule out the study of speech within linguistics? Was he a reductionist? These disputes and many others can now be resolved on basis of the work now published. This reveals new depth and subtetly in Saussure's thoughts on the nature and complex workings of language, particularly his famous binary oppositions between form and meaning, the sign and what is signified, and language (langue) and its performance (parole).",5,N/A

A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages,['Mikhail Sergeevich Andronov'],2003,['Foreign Language Study'],"Due to their crucial role one of the major tasks in modern South Asia linguistics is the research of the historical view of the Dravidian Languages. A knowledge of the Dravidian language structure in all its development stages, from their earliest beginnings to today, is necessary for understanding numerous fundamental aspects with the emergence of the indoarian, Munda and other languages of south Asia and of course for the history of the Dravidian language family itself. The Comparative Grammar forms an important part of the historical linguistics. Yet Richard Caldwell's Comparative Grammar of Dravidian or South Indian Family of Languages (London, 1856, 2/1875, 3/1913) is outdated. An up to date comparative grammar of the Dravidian languages therefore was long overdue. With the work of the renowned Russian Dravidian scientist Mikhail S. Andronov, in which the over 80 known, investigated and described languages and dialects of the Dravidian language family are taken in consideration, this gap has been closed.",N/A,N/A

Language Form and Language Function,['Frederick J. Newmeyer'],2000,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"The two basic approaches to linguistics are the formalist and the functionalist approaches. In this engaging monograph, Frederick J. Newmeyer, a formalist, argues that both approaches are valid. However, because formal and functional linguists have avoided direct confrontation, they remain unaware of the compatability of their results. One of the author's goals is to make each side accessible to the other. While remaining an ardent formalist, Newmeyer stresses the limitations of a narrow formalist outlook that refuses to consider that anything of interest might have been discovered in the course of functionalist-oriented research. He argues that the basic principles of generative grammar, in interaction with principles in other linguistic domains, provide compelling accounts of phenomena that functionalists have used to try to refute the generative approach.",N/A,N/A

Verbal Hygiene,['Deborah Cameron'],1995,['Foreign Language Study'],"BAAL Book Prize Winner 1996 In this award winning book Deborah Cameron takes a serious look at popular attitudes towards language and examines the practices by which people attempt to regulate its use. Instead of dismissing the practice of 'verbal hygiene', as a misguided and pernicious exercise, however, she argues that popular discourse about language values; good and bad, right and wrong, serves an important function for those engaged in it. A series of case-studies deal with specific examples of verbal hygiene: the regulation of 'style' by editors, the teaching of English grammar in schools, the movements for and against so-called 'politically-correct' language and the recent explosion of advice to women on how they can speak more effectively. In each case she argues that verbal hygiene provides a way of making sense of linguistic phenomena, and that it represents a symbolic attempt to impose order on the social world. Addressed to linguistics, professional language-users of all kinds, and to anyone interested in language and culture, Verbal Hygiene, calls for legitimate concerns about language and value to be discussed, by experts and lay-speakers alike, in a rational and critical spirit.",N/A,N/A

The Linguistics Wars,['Randy Allen Harris'],1993,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"Since the mid-twentieth century, the field of linguistics has been a tumultuous discipline. The Linguistics Wars tells the story of the acrimonious schism, during the sixties and seventies, that divided the ranks of linguistics after the publication of Noam Chomsky's influental Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. This schism began when some of Chomsky's earliest followers formed a splinter group and began to take Chomsky's ideas in a direction he found uncongenial. Chomsky rejected the extensions these former followers were taking, commencing a decade of infighting that generated a good deal of noise, lasting bitterness, and vast amounts of knowledge in the field. While Chomsky won the battle, the features of generative semantics made their way into other approaches and continue to influence linguistics to this very day. Full of anecdotes and personalities, The Linguistic Wars is not only a riveting narrative of the course of this important intellectual controversy, but a revealing look into how scientists and scholars actually negotiate such theories and approaches.",N/A,N/A

The Political Psychology of the Veil,['Sahar Ghumkhor'],2019-11-21,['Political Science'],"Veiled women in the West appear menacing. Their visible invisibility is a cause of obsession. What is beneath the veil more than a woman? This book investigates the preoccupation with the veiled body through the imaging and imagining of Muslim women. It examines the relationship between the body and knowledge through the politics of freedom as grounded in a ‘natural’ body, in the index of flesh. The impulse to unveil is more than a desire to free the Muslim woman. What lies at the heart of the fantasy of saving the Muslim woman is the West’s desire to save itself. The preoccupation with the veiled woman is a defense that preserves neither the object of orientalism nor the difference embodied in women’s bodies, but inversely, insists on the corporeal boundaries of the West’s mode of knowing and truth-making. The book contends that the imagination of unveiling restores the West’s sense of its own power and enables it to intrude where it is ‘other’ – thus making it the centre and the agent by promising universal freedom, all the while stifling the question of what freedom is.",N/A,N/A

After Babel,['George Steiner'],1975,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"When it first appeared in 1975, After Babel created a sensation, quickly establishing itself as both a controversial and seminal study of literary theory. In the original edition, Steiner provided readers with the first systematic investigation since the eighteenth century of the phenomenology and processes of translation both inside and between languages. Taking issue with the principal emphasis of modern linguistics, he finds the root of the ""Babel problem"" in our deep instinct for privacy and territory, noting that every people has in its language a unique body of shared secrecy. With this provocative thesis he analyzes every aspect of translation from fundamental conditions of interpretation to the most intricate of linguistic constructions.For the long-awaited second edition, Steiner entirely revised the text, added new and expanded notes, and wrote a new preface setting the work in the present context of hermeneutics, poetics, and translation studies. This new edition brings the bibliography up to the present with substantially updated references, including much Russian and Eastern European material.

Foundations of Cognitive Grammar,[],1987,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"This is the second volume of a two-volume work that introduces a new and fundamentally different conception of language structure and linguistic investigation. The central claim of cognitive grammar is that grammar forms a continuum with lexicon and is fully describable in terms of symbolic units (i.e. form-meaning pairings). In contrast to current orthodoxy, the author argues that grammar is not autonomous with respect to semantics, but rather reduces to patterns for the structuring and symbolization of conceptual content. This volume suggests how to use the theoretical tools presented in Volume I, applying cognitive grammar to a broad array of representative grammatical phenomena, primarily (but by no means exclusively) drawn from English. Reviews ""The amount of data and the wealth of analyses presented is impressive. . . . Langacker has again succeeded in producing a very stimulating and coherent piece of work. And the material analyses offered deserve much more careful attention and reflection than is possible within the limits of a review."" —Canadian Journal of Linguistics ""Finding ways to talk about language as a cognitive process intricately interwoven with conceptual behavior seems to be the unifying concern of cognitive linguistics in general, and Langacker's work is of major significance in this respect.

I will try to explain the relationship between logical, orderly, conscious, rule-following reason and fluid, self organizing, habit-governed, unconscious, chaos-infused intuition. My previous two books, The Structure of Intelligence and The Evolving Mind, briefly touched on this relationship. But these books were primarily concerned with other matters: SI with constructing a formal language for discussing mentality and its mechanization, and EM with exploring the role of evolution in thought. They danced around the edges of the order/chaos problem, without ever fully entering into it. My goal in writing this book was to go directly to the core of mental process, ""where angels fear to tread"" -- to tackle all the sticky issues which it is considered prudent to avoid: the nature of consciousness, the relation between mind and reality, the justification of belief systems, the connection between creativity and mental illness,.... All of these issues are dealt with here in a straightforward and unified way, using a combination of concepts from my previous work with ideas from chaos theory and complex systems science.",5,N/A

Wróblewski ́s three ideologies (bound/free/legal and rational) and Makkonen ́s three situations (isomorphic/semantically vague/normative gap) of judicial decision-making are further developed by means of 10 frames of legal analysis as discerned by the author. With the philosophical theories of truth serving as a reference, the frames of legal analysis include the isomorphic theory of law (Wittgenstein, Makkonen), the coherence theory of law (Alexy, Peczenik, Dworkin), the new rhetoric and legal argumentation theory (Perelman, Aarnio), social consequentialism (Posner), natural law theory (Fuller, Finnis), and the sequential model of legal reasoning by Neil MacCormick and the Bielefelder Kreis.

Probabilistic Linguistics,"['Rens Bod', 'Jennifer Hay', 'Stefanie Jannedy']",2003,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"For the past forty years, linguistics has been dominated by the idea that language is categorical and linguistic competence discrete. It has become increasingly clear, however, that many levels of representation, from phonemes to sentence structure, show probabilistic properties, as does the language faculty. Probabilistic linguistics conceptualizes categories as distributions and views knowledge of language not as a minimal set of categorical constraints but as a set of gradient rules that may be characterized by a statistical distribution. Whereas categorical approaches focus on the endpoints of distributions of linguistic phenomena, probabilistic approaches focus on the gradient middle ground. Probabilistic linguistics integrates all the progress made by linguistics thus far with a probabilistic perspective. This book presents a comprehensive introduction to probabilistic approaches to linguistic inquiry. It covers the application of probabilistic techniques to phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, language acquisition, psycholinguistics, historical linguistics, and sociolinguistics. It also includes a tutorial on elementary probability theory and probabilistic grammars.",N/A,N/A

On Language,['Roman Jakobson'],1990,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"One measure of Roman Jakobson's towering role in linguistics is that his work has defined the field itself. Jakobson's contributions have now become a permanent part of American and European views on language. With his uncanny ability to survive devastating uprooting again and again--from Moscow to Prague to Upsalla to New York and finally to Cambridge--Jakobson was able to bring to each milieu new and stimulating ideas, which have broadened the perspective of linguistics while giving it new direction and specifying its domain. Linda Waugh and Monique Monville-Burston have assembled an intellectual overview of his work in linguistics from partial and complete works that they have arranged, introduced, and cross-referenced. Some appear here in print for the first time, others are newly translated into English. More than a convenient access to Jakobson's basic works, On Language presents a broad profile of the polymathic general linguist who suggested radical innovations in every area of linguistic theory. The breadth of Jakobson's engagement in linguistics is captured by the editors' informative introduction and by their perspicacious presentation of topics. His general view of the science of linguistics is followed by his stunning contributions to linguistic metatheory in the areas of structure and function. Various aspects of historical, typological, and sociolinguistics are also explored along with his phonological theory--perhaps his most influential contribution--and his views on grammatical semantics. A topic that increasingly preoccupied Jakobson in his later career, the interrelationship between sound and meaning, is presented here in detail. The concluding three essays focus on the various relations between linguistics and the human and natural sciences, which led Jakobson ultimately to be characterized as an interdisciplinary thinker.",N/A,N/A

Chinese History and Literature,['J. Prusek'],1970-12-31,['Foreign Language Study'],"The studies contained in this volume arose over the last thirty years. Originally the range of the materials I intended to include in my selection was very much wider.

At first I intended to include all the studies I supposed might be of interest to readers and represent contributi ons still of some significance for research in this domain of Oriental scholarship.

The Language of Protest,['Mary Lynne Gasaway Hill'],2018-04-16,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"Rooted in the performative of Speech Act Theory, this interdisciplinary study crafts a new model to compare the work we do with words when we protest: across genres, from different geographies and languages. Rich with illustrative examples from Turkey, U.S., West Germany, Romania, Guatemala, Great Britain, and Northern Ireland, it examines the language of protest (chants, songs, poetry and prose) with an innovative use of analytical tools that will advance current theory. Operating at the intersection of linguistic pragmatics and critical discourse analysis this book provides fresh insights on interdisciplinary topics including power, identity, legitimacy and the Social Contract. In doing so it will appeal to students and scholars of sociolinguistics, pragmatics and critical discourse analysis, in addition to researchers working in sociology, political science, discourse, cultural and communication studies.",N/A,N/A

The Essential Chomsky,"['Noam Chomsky', 'Joshua Daniel']",2008-03,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"In a single volume, the seminal writings of the world's leading philosopher, linguist, and critic, published to coincide with his eightieth birthday. For the past forty years Noam Chomsky's writings on politics and language have established him as a preeminent public intellectual and as one of the most original and wide-ranging political and social critics of our time. Among the seminal figures in linguistic theory over the past century, since the 1960s Chomsky has also secured a place as perhaps the leading dissident voice in the United States. Chomsky's many bestselling works--including ""Manufacturing Consent, Hegemony or Survival, Understanding Power,"" and ""Failed States""--have served as essential touchstones for dissidents, activists, scholars, and concerned citizens on subjects ranging from the media to human rights to intellectual freedom. In particular, Chomsky's scathing critiques of the U.S. wars in Vietnam, Central America, and the Middle East have furnished a widely accepted intellectual inspiration for antiwar movements over nearly four decades. The Essential Chomsky assembles the core of his most important writings, including excerpts from his most influential texts over the past forty years. Here is an unprecedented, comprehensive overview of Chomsky's thought.",N/A,N/A

Introducing English Linguistics,['Charles F. Meyer'],2009,['English language'],"Are you looking for a genuine introduction to the linguistics of English that provides a broad overview of the subject that sustains students' interest and avoids excessive detail? Introducing English Linguistics accomplishes this goal in two ways. First, it takes a top-down approach to language, beginning with the largest unit of linguistic structure, the text, and working its way down through successively smaller structures (sentences, words, and finally speech sounds). The advantage of presenting language this way is that students are first given the larger picture - they study language in context - and then see how the smaller pieces of language are a consequence of the larger goals of linguistic communication. Second, the book does not contain invented examples, as is the case with most comparable texts, but instead takes its sample materials from the major computerised databases of spoken and written English, giving students a more realistic view of language.",N/A,N/A
Research Methods in Linguistics,['Lia Litosseliti'],2025-01-09,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"Research Methods in Linguistics guides the reader through the key issues, principles, and contributions of core methods in linguistic research. It is an essential resource for researchers and graduate students looking for clear introductions to key concepts, accessible discussions of theory and practice through illustrative examples, and critical engagement with current debates. Topics covered include developing research questions; combining methods; quantitative research designs (including questionnaires, chi-square tests and t-tests); corpus analysis; and qualitative research methods (interview methods, discourse analytic approaches and multimodal analysis). Expanded throughout, this third edition also includes: · New chapters on linguistic anthropology and digital discourse analysis · Updated further reading lists and discussion questions · Refreshed examples, engaging with more recent sources and materials · A glossary of key terms for each chapter · Learning outcomes at the start of each chapter. Guiding you through all the main issues, techniques and approaches to developing your research, this book provides clear introductions to key concepts and discussions, and takes you step-by-step through topics such as how to conduct your own focus groups and interviews, how to build case studies and how to make sense of your data. Leading you towards the research methods most appropriate to your work, and explaining them in detail, this is the only book you need in linguistic research methods.",N/A,N/A

Linguistic Analysis of Biblical Hebrew,['Susan Anne Groom'],2003,['Foreign Language Study'],"Many linguistic tools and methods are applied to biblical texts in order to gain meaning from them. Such applications do not always take into account the perspective of the investigators, the presuppositions of the method used and the nature of the material to which it is applied. These are all factors that influence the meaning obtained from the text. Sue Groom takes us through the pitfalls and limitations of the various methods available and considers textual transmission, diachronic and dialectical variation and the impact these have on the relationship between reader, author and text. Combining a critical account of long established approaches to Hebrew meanings with a lucid introduction to newer and more recent methods such as lexical semantics and text linguistics, this illuminating read will be of interest to those who have previously studied Hebrew as well as those who know no Hebrew or would like to start somewhere.",N/A,N/A

English Syntax and Argumentation,['Bas Aarts'],2017-08-22,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"This textbook aims to give students a thorough grounding in the basics of sentence structure, and to acquaint them with the essentials of syntactic argument. Aarts provides further reading lists and end-of-chapter exercises. How can we go about describing the structure of sentences? What do we learn from analysing language in this way? This book examines the nuts and bolts of English syntax in an accessible way. The book starts with a discussion of the basic concepts that underpin the study of syntax, then moves on to more complex issues. Each chapter carefully explains technical terms and uses easy-to-follow examples and hands-on exercises to illuminate key ideas. The fifth edition has been thoroughly revised throughout, and a new chapter on information structuring has been added. From words and phrases to constituency and argumentation, the book's broad coverage and clear organisation make it essential reading for all students of English and linguistics who are encountering the study of syntax for the first time",N/A,N/A

"Borges, Language and Reality",['Alfonso J. García-Osuna'],2019-12-21,['Literary Criticism'],"This book brings together the work of several scholars to shed light on the Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges' complex relationship with language and reality. A critical assumption driving the work is that there is, as Jaime Alazraki has put it, 'a genuine effort to overcome the narrowness that Western tradition has imposed as a master and measure of reality' in Borges' writing. That narrowness is in large measure a consequence of the chronic influence of positivist approaches to reality that rely on empirical evidence for any authentication of what is 'real'. This study shows that, in opposition to such restrictions, Borges saw in fiction, in literature, the most viable means of discussing reality in a pragmatic manner. Moreover, by scrutinising several of the author's works, it establishes signposts for considering the truly complicated relationship that Borges had with reality, one that intimately associates the 'real' with human perception, insight and language.",N/A,N/A
The New Comparative Syntax,['Liliane M. V. Haegeman'],1997,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"Drawing upon recent theoretical developments and empirical discoveries, this book provides a coherent and comprehensive introdution to generative research in this field. Dr. Haegeman brings together ten chapters to illustrate the new appraoch to comparative grammar which has developed against the background of the 'principles and parameters' model. The contributors show how this framework guides empirical research by seeking to reveal the underlying grammatical basis for similarities and differences between languages and language groups. Throughout the text, attention is drawn to the ways in which empirical study feeds into theory construction, raising new questions for the overall conceptual framework and sometimes providing new solution",N/A,N/A

Cartesian Linguistics,['Noam Chomsky'],1966,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"As James McGilvray remarks in his introduction to this new edition of Cartesian Linguistics, the book was largely ignored and indeed denounced when first published in 1966. One likely reason why the first edition was ignored is that it contained many untranslated quotations from French and German authors. For this new edition these passages have all been translated into English. Perhaps the main reason why it was denounced is that Cartesian Linguistics contains, implicitly if not explicitly, trenchant criticisms of empiricist theories about linguistics and the mind. Due largely to Chomsky's efforts, these are not so dominant now as they were when the first edition appeared in 1966, although they still command the attention of researchers and the public imagination. In his introduction Professor McGilvray focuses on the contrast between rationalist and empiricist approaches to language and the mind. He discusses at length the two most distinctive features of what he calls Chomsky's ""rationalist-romantic"" approach: its emphasis on linguistic creativity and its insistence that this creativity can be explained only by assuming that humans are endowed with innate concepts and mental faculties. In the course of the discussion he connects Chomsky's early treatment of these themes with his later development of them, and with Chomsky's well-known views on politics and education.",N/A,N/A
