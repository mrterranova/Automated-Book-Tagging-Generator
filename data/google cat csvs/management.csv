Doing the Right Things Right,['Laura Stack'],2016-01-18,['Business & Economics'],"A How-To Guide for the Modern Leader Inspired by Peter Drucker's groundbreaking book The Effective Executive, Laura Stack details precisely how 21st-century leaders and managers can obtain profitable, productive results by managing the intersection of two critical values: effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness, Stack says, is identifying and achieving the best objectives for your organization—doing the right things. Efficiency is accomplishing them with the least amount of time, effort, and cost—doing things right. If you're not clear on both, you're wasting your time. As Drucker put it, “There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.” Stack's 3T Leadership offers twelve practices that will enable executives to be effective and efficient, grouped into three areas where leaders spend their time: Strategic Thinking, Teamwork, and Tactics. With her expert advice, you'll get scores of new ideas on how you, your team, and your organization can boost productivity.",N/A,N/A,en
Successful Management by Motivation,"['Bruno S.

Successful Management by Motivation shows that in a knowledge-based society, this goal cannot be achieved by extrinsic motivation alone. Pay for performance often even hurts because it crowds out intrinsic motivation. To succeed, companies have to find ways of fostering and sustaining intrinsic motivation. With the help of in-depth case studies, representative surveys, and analysis based on a large number of firms and employees, this work identifies the various aspects of motivation in companies and shows how the right combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can be achieved.",N/A,N/A,en

Global Positioning System,"['Bernhard Hofmann-Wellenhof', 'Herbert Lichtenegger', 'James Collins']",2013-04-17,['Science'],"This book is dedicated to Dr. Benjamin William Remondi for many reasons. The project of writing a Global Positioning System (GPS) book was con ceived in April 1988 at a GPS meeting in Darmstadt. Dr. Remondi discussed with me the need for an additional GPS textbook and suggested a possible joint effort. In 1989, I was willing to commit myself to such a project. Un fortunately, the timing was less than ideal for Dr. Remondi. Therefore, I decided to start the project with other coauthors. Dr. Remondi agreed and indicated his willingness to be a reviewer. I selected Dr. Herbert Lichtenegger, my colleague from the University of Technology at Graz, Austria, and Dr. James Collins from the United States. In my opinion, the knowledge of the three authors should cover the wide spectrum of GPS. Dr. Lichtenegger is a geodesist with broad experience in both theory and practice. He has specialized his research to geodetic astron omy including orbital theory and geodynamical phenomena. Since 1986, Dr. Lichtenegger's main interest is dedicated to GPS. Dr. Collins retired from the U.S. National Geodetic Survey in 1980, where he was the Deputy Director. For the past ten years, he has been deeply involved in using GPS technology with an emphasis on surveying. Dr. Collins was the founder and president of Geo/Hydro Inc.

Enterprise Architecture at Work,['Marc Lankhorst'],2017-03-10,['Computers'],"Lankhorst and his co‐authors present ArchiMate® 3.0, enterprise modelling language that captures the complexity of architectural domains and their relations and allows the construction of integrated enterprise architecture models. They provide architects with concrete instruments that improve their architectural practice. As this is not enough, they additionally present techniques and heuristics for communicating with all relevant stakeholders about these architectures. Since an architecture model is useful not only for providing insight into the current or future situation but can also be used to evaluate the transition from ‘as‐is’ to ‘to‐be’, the authors also describe analysis methods for assessing both the qualitative impact of changes to an architecture and the quantitative aspects of architectures, such as performance and cost issues. The modelling language presented has been proven in practice in many real‐life case studies and has been adopted by The Open Group as an international standard. So this book is an ideal companion for enterprise IT or business architects in industry as well as for computer or management science students studying the field of enterprise architecture. This fourth edition of the book has been completely reworked to be compatible with ArchiMate® 3.0, and it includes a new chapter relating this new version to other standards. New sections on capability analysis, risk analysis, and business architecture in general have also been introduced.",N/A,N/A,en

Interest in circular business models is growing within academic and practitioner literature yet the concept is not clearly understood, with potential negative consequences for theory building and practical implementation. Therefore, this book conceptualises circular business models and investigates their theoretical foundations in relation to the rationale for adopting them, drawing on circular economy, business model, strategic management and neo-institutional literature and secondary data.",N/A,N/A,en

Competency Management in the Public Sector,['Instituut voor de Overheid'],2002,['Business & Economics'],"Annotation Competency Management is increasingly being adopted as an approach to HRM in both the private and public sectors. This book will be of interest to both practitioners and academics as it seeks to inform the reader about the practice of competency management in European public services. It throws light on the origins and meanings of the concept and traces the competency movement from the 1980s in the UK and USA. It links competency management to performance management and HRM and demonstrates how a competency approach can add value to all parts of an organisation. The nine country studies provide a rich insight into the practices found across the public sectors of Europe. At one end of the spectrum is Britain with its holistic approach to competency management in the Senior Civil Service and widespread use throughout the rest of the service. Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland provide further examples of recent developments and good practice. In France and Germany, however, competency management has only just appeared on the reform agenda and the reasons for this are identified. Micro studies in Italy and Sweden provide an insight into the problems that arise when the perceptions of reformers diverge from those of managers and managed, while the study of Poland shows the problems faced by countries in transition which lack an appropriate educational sub-structure for public management and HRM.",N/A,N/A,en
Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity,['Newton Lee'],2013-04-15,['Computers'],"Imagine James Bond meets Sherlock Holmes: Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity is the sequel to Facebook Nation in the Total Information Awareness book series by Newton Lee.

Yet most organizations haven’t yet realized the elusive bene?ts of these two important disciplines. The reasons for this are manifold. However, the primary causes are the culture of the organization and it leadership. This is a topic, which I’ve addressed at length in my latest book: Pro?les in Performance – Business Intelligence Journeys and the Roadmap for Change. The culture and leadership of the organization determines the importance and strategic intent surrounding the use of BI and PM. Sadly, most organizations lack the motivation to embrace transparency and accountability – or to align with the strategy of the organization – enabling execution and coordination in unison with the mission. However, once an organization and its leadership are ready to take a step towards real change – creating an environment of openness, sharing and alignment – with BI and PM as its centerpiece – the next question then becomes one of “how and where to begin”? Even with great strategic intent, missteps in the development and deployment of BI and PM and can cause disillusionment and disappointment – lending support to the naysayers of the organization – and leading to failure and abandonment of these critical programs.",N/A,N/A,en

How Will You Measure Your Life?,['Clayton M. Christensen'],2017,['BUSINESS & ECONOMICS'],"Harvard Business School's Clayton M. Christensen teaches aspiring MBAs how to apply management and innovation theories to build stronger companies. But he also believes that these models can help people lead better lives. In this book, he explains how, exploring questions everyone needs to ask: How can I be happy in my career? How can I be sure that my relationship with my family is an enduring source of happiness? How can I live my life with integrity? The answer to the first question comes from Frederick Herzberg's assertion that the most powerful motivator isn't money; it's the opportunity to learn, grow in responsibilities, contribute, and be recognized. Management isn't about buying, selling, and investing in companies, as many think. The principles of resource allocation can help people attain happiness at home. If not managed masterfully, what emerges from a firm's resource allocation process can be very different from the strategy management intended to follow. That's true in life too: If you're not guided by a clear sense of purpose, you're likely to fritter away your time and energy on obtaining the most tangible, short-term signs of achievement, not what's really important to you. And just as a focus on marginal costs can cause bad corporate decisions, it can lead people astray. The marginal cost of doing something wrong ""just this once"" always seems alluringly low. You don't see the end result to which that path leads. The key is to define what you stand for and draw the line in a safe place.--",N/A,N/A,en

It also shows how to achieve high performance successfully in a digital business environment. Static business models do not keep pace with the dynamic changes in our digital world. Organizations need a management approach that fits this environment and capitalizes on its opportunities while minimizing the related risks. They need to execute their business strategy fast and reliably. In effect, they have to know how and when to modify or enhance their business processes, which processes are the best candidates for intervention, and how to move rapidly from strategy to execution. This means organizations need to establish business process management as a real management discipline. The importance of process innovation, digital technology and people aspects, process governance, internationalization, emerging processes and the unique situation in mid-market organizations are some of the key topics discussed in this book. It ends with a comprehensive case study and a discussion about what process engineers can learn from jazz musicians.",N/A,N/A,en

Why do we sell less in this country? Many companies fail to acknowledge and analyze disparities observed among customers and simply put them down to culture or emotion. New neuroendocrinological research proves that consumers are rational: They just have a different biological perception of the same stimulus! Their preferences, behavior, and decisions are strongly influenced by the hundredsof millions of sensors monitoring their body and brain. People with more taste buds are for example sensitive to bitterness and are more likely to drink their coffee with sugar or milk, or to drink tea. After reading the book, managers will be able to: • Understand and predict consumers’ behavior and preferences • Design the right sensory mix (color, shape, taste, smell, texture, and sound) for each product • Fine-tune their positioning and product range for every local market • Systematically increase their innovation hit rate",2.5,N/A,en
RESISTANCE TO CHANGE - A NEW PERSPECTIVE: A Textbook for Managers Who Plan to Implement a Change,['Daniela Bradutanu'],2015-09,['Business & Economics'],"The intention for this book is to present the resistance to change phenomenon from a new perspective. The term resistance is complex and very often misinterpreted. Change leaders should adapt their perspectives on this subject and try to see resistance from a positive angle as well. By just changing the prospect of analyzing it, managers could experience a greater success in implementing new changes and effectively attract more employees onto their side. Instead of trying to eliminate or suppress employees' resistance, managers should rather use their reactions in a positive framework. Resistance may be useful as feedback and therefore, managers can use it to improve and refine the organizational change process.",N/A,N/A,en

Office Politics,['Oliver James'],2012-05-01,['Interpersonal communication'],"Success at work now depends less and less on how good you are at specific skills and more and more on office politics. Often thought of as a dirty word, office politics is in fact an inevitable part of working life and is a major contributor to a successful career.

If Aristotle Ran General Motors,['Thomas V. Morris'],1997-09-15,['Business & Economics'],"What does classical philosophy have to offer modern business? Nothing less than the secrets to building great morale and productivity in any size organization. This is the message that Tom Morris will deliver this year to thousands of executives of leading companies such as Merrill Lynch, Coca Cola, Bayer, and Northwestern Mutual Life. In If Aristotle Ran General Motors, Morris, who taught philosophy at Notre Dame for fifteen years, shares the knowledge that he garnered from a lifetime of studying the writings and teachings of history's wisest thinkers and shows how to apply their ideas in today's business environment. Although he frequently draws on the wisdom of Aristotle, Morris also finds inspiration in the teachings of a wide array of thinkers from many different traditions and eras. Throughout these pages we're invited to pause and consider the words of Confucius, Seneca, Saint Augustine, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Abraham Lincoln, and many others. By looking at the inside workings of various kinds of businesses-- from GE to Tom's of Maine-- Morris shows why any company that is serious about attaining true excellence must adhere to four timeless virtues first identified by Aristotle more than two thousand years ago: Truth, Beauty, Goodness, and Unity. Morris makes clear that the most successful companies encourage a corporate culture that ensures that all interactions among colleagues, employees, bosses, clients, customers, and suppliers are infused with dignity and humanity. Moreover, the book provides clearly stated strategies for how everyone who works can make these qualities the foundation for their everyday business (and personal) lives. If Aristotle Ran General Motors presents the most compelling case of any book yet written for a new ethics in business and for a workplace where openness and integrity are the rule rather than the exception. It offers an optimistic vision for the future and a plan for reinvigorating the soul back into our professional lives.",N/A,N/A,en
