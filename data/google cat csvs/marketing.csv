Principles of Forecasting,['J.S. Armstrong'],2001-05-31,['Business & Economics'],"Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook for Researchers and Practitioners summarizes knowledge from experts and from empirical studies. It provides guidelines that can be applied in fields such as economics, sociology, and psychology. It applies to problems such as those in finance (How much is this company worth?), marketing (Will a new product be successful?), personnel (How can we identify the best job candidates?), and production (What level of inventories should be kept?). The book is edited by Professor J. Scott Armstrong of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Contributions were written by 40 leading experts in forecasting, and the 30 chapters cover all types of forecasting methods. There are judgmental methods such as Delphi, role-playing, and intentions studies. Quantitative methods include econometric methods, expert systems, and extrapolation. Some methods, such as conjoint analysis, analogies, and rule-based forecasting, integrate quantitative and judgmental procedures. In each area, the authors identify what is known in the form of `if-then principles', and they summarize evidence on these principles. The project, developed over a four-year period, represents the first book to summarize all that is known about forecasting and to present it so that it can be used by researchers and practitioners. To ensure that the principles are correct, the authors reviewed one another's papers. In addition, external reviews were provided by more than 120 experts, some of whom reviewed many of the papers.

Market Segmentation,"['Michel Wedel', 'Wagner A. Kamakura']",2012-12-06,['Business & Economics'],"Modern marketing techniques in industrialized countries cannot be implemented without segmentation of the potential market. Goods are no longer produced and sold without a significant consideration of customer needs combined with a recognition that these needs are heterogeneous. Since first emerging in the late 1950s, the concept of segmentation has been one of the most researched topics in the marketing literature. Segmentation has become a central topic to both the theory and practice of marketing, particularly in the recent development of finite mixture models to better identify market segments. This second edition of Market Segmentation updates and extends the integrated examination of segmentation theory and methodology begun in the first edition. A chapter on mixture model analysis of paired comparison data has been added, together with a new chapter on the pros and cons of the mixture model. The book starts with a framework for considering the various bases and methods available for conducting segmentation studies. The second section contains a more detailed discussion of the methodology for market segmentation, from traditional clustering algorithms to more recent developments in finite mixtures and latent class models. Three types of finite mixture models are discussed in this second section: simple mixtures, mixtures of regressions and mixtures of unfolding models. The third main section is devoted to special topics in market segmentation such as joint segmentation, segmentation using tailored interviewing and segmentation with structural equation models. The fourth part covers four major approaches to applied market segmentation: geo-demographic, lifestyle, response-based, and conjoint analysis. The final concluding section discusses directions for further research.",N/A,N/A,en

Marketing Moves,"['Philip Kotler', 'Dipak Jain', 'Suvit Maesincee']",2002,['Business & Economics'],"The Internet, globalization, and hypercompetition are dramatically reshaping markets and changing the way business is done. The problem, says internationally renowned marketer Philip Kotler and his coauthors Dipak C. Jain and Suvit Maesincee, is that marketing has not kept pace with the markets. In today's world, customers are scarce-not products-and classic marketing needs to be deconstructed, redefined, and broadened to reflect this new reality. Marketing Moves describes the next transformational imperative for marketing-and for any organization competing in our customer-ruled, technology-driven marketplace. It calls for a fundamental rethinking of corporate strategy to enable the ongoing creation and delivery of superior value for customers in both the marketplace and the marketspace. And it appoints marketing as the lead driver in shaping and implementing this new strategy. The means for accomplishing this lies in a radically new marketing paradigm the authors call holistic marketing -a dynamic concept derived from the electronic connectivity and interactivity among companies, customers, and collaborators. This new paradigm combines the best of traditional marketing with new digital capabilities to build long-term, mutually satisfying relationships and co-prosperity among all key stakeholders. Outlining a framework for implementing holistic marketing that calls for integrating customer demand management, internal and external resource allocation, and network collaboration-the authors show how holistic marketing can enable companies to: - Identify new value opportunities for renewing their markets - Efficiently create the most promising new value offerings - Deliver products, services, and experiences that more precisely match individual customer requirements - Consistently operate at the highest level of product quality, service, and speed Thought-provoking and practical, Marketing Moves shows how to build a complete marketing platform primed for the challenges and opportunities of a customer-centric world.

Price Management,"['Hermann Simon', 'Martin Fassnacht']",2018-12-11,['Business & Economics'],"In this book, the world’s foremost experts on pricing integrate theoretical rigor and practical application to present a comprehensive resource that covers all areas of the field. This volume brings together quantitative and qualitative approaches and highlights the most current innovations in theory and practice. Going beyond the traditional constraints of “price theory” and “price policy,” the authors coined the term “price management” to represent a holistic approach to pricing strategy and tactical implementation. They remind us that the Ancient Romans used one word, pretium, to mean both price and value. This is the fundamental philosophy that drives successful price management where producer and customer meet. Featuring dozens of examples and case studies drawn from their extensive research, consulting, and teaching around the world, Simon and Fassnacht cover all aspects of pricing following the price management process with its four phases: strategy, analysis, decision, and implementation. Thereby, the authors take into account the nuances across industry sectors, including consumer goods, industrial products, services, and trade/distribution. In particular, they address the implications of technological advancements, such as the Internet and new measurement and sensor technologies that have led to a wealth of price management innovations, such as flat rates, freemium, pay-per-use, or pay-what-you-want. They also address the emergence of new price metrics, Big Data applications, two-sided price systems, negative prices, and the sharing economy, as well as emerging payment systems such as bitcoin. The result is a “bible” for leaders who recognize that price is not only a means to drive profit in the short term, but a tool to generate sustained growth in shareholder value over the longer term, and a primer for researchers, instructors, and students alike. Praise for Price Management “This book is truly state of the art and the most comprehensive work in price management.” - Prof. Philip Kotler, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University “This very important book builds an outstanding bridge between science and practice.“ - Kasper Rorsted, CEO, Adidas “This book provides practical guidelines on value creation, communication and management, which is an imperative for businesses to survive in the coming era of uncertainty.” - Dr. Chang-Gyu Hwang, Chairman and CEO, KT Corporation (Korea Telecom)",N/A,N/A,en

Entrepreneurial Marketing,"['Edwin J. Nijssen', 'Ed Nijssen']",2014-04-29,['Business & Economics'],"How do you sell a totally new kind of product to a market that does not yet exist? Entrepreneurial businesses often create products and services based on radically new technology that has the power to change the marketplace. This means that existing market research will have produced data about market categories and structures that are largely irrelevant to the entrepreneur. This complicates the sales and marketing functions for new products that may be hard for the market to understand in the first place. Entrepreneurial Marketing focuses on this special challenge: new marketing methods for new products. Classic core marketing concepts, such as segmentation, positioning, and the marketing mix undergo an ""extreme makeover"" in the context of innovative products hitting the market. The author stresses effectuation, iterative thinking, principles of affordable loss, adjustment for emerging opportunities, and cooperation with first customers. This new textbook provides students of entrepreneurial marketing with everything they need to know to succeed in their classes as well as practical tools and techniques that will be useful after the exams have finished.",N/A,N/A,en

Winning in Emerging Markets,"['Tarun Khanna', 'Krishna G. Palepu']",2010,['Business & Economics'],"About the Book : - The best way to select emerging markets to exploit is to evaluate their size or growth potential, right? Not according to Tarun Khanna and Krishna Palepu. In Winning in Emerging Markets, these leading scholars on the subject present a decidedly different framework for making this crucial choice. The authors argue that the primary exploitable characteristic of emerging markets is the lack of institutions (credit card systems, intellectual property adjudication, data research firms) that facilitate efficient business operations. While such institutional voidspresent challenges, they also provide major opportunities for multinationals and local contenders. Khanna and Palepu provide a playbook for assessing emerging markets potential and for crafting strategies for succeeding in those markets. They explain how to: Spot institutional voids in developing economies, including in product, labour, and capital markets, as well as social and political systems Identify opportunities to fill those voids, for example, by building or improving market institutions yourself Exploit those opportunities through a rigorous five-phase process, including studying the market over time and acquiring new capabilities Packed with vivid examples and practical toolkits, Winning in Emerging Markets is a crucial resource for any company seeking to define and execute business strategy in developing economies. About the Authors : - Tarun Khanna is the Jorge Paulo Lemann Professor at Harvard Business School and the author of Billions of Entrepreneurs: How China and India Are Reshaping Their Future and Yours.

It demystifies how marketers can significantly improve their measurement and management infrastructure in order to improve their return on marketing effectiveness and ROI. They will be able to significantly improve their tactical and strategic decision-making and finally be able to respond to John Wannamachers' ""half of my advertising is wasted; I just don't know which half."" With this in hand, they will be able to avoid the budget cutting ax, become a critical component of corporate success and enhance their careers. Even in a crowded theoretical marketing environment there are three new concepts being introduced: 1. The Marketing Effectiveness Framework to help marketers talk the talk of marketing effectiveness within marketing and with the C-Suite. 2. The Marketing Effectiveness Continuum to help marketers understand the organizational issues and change management associated with delivering long lasting enhanced marketing effectiveness. 3. The Marketing Accountability Framework to help marketers begin to collect data that is meaningful to improving their marketing effectiveness and to become accountable for their results.

The Emperor Domitian,['Brian W. Jones'],1992,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Domitian, Emperor of Rome AD 81-96, has traditionally been portrayed as a tyrant and his later years on the throne as a reign of terror'; his death bringing a restoration of liberty and inaugurating the glorious rule of the five good emperors'. It is less well known that he was an able, meticulous administrator, a reformer of the economy, with a building programme designed to ensure that Rome not only was the capital of the world but looked like it as well. Brian Jones's biography of the emperor, the first ever in English and the first in any language for nearly a century, offers a balanced interpretation of the life of Domitian. In taking into account recent scholarship and new epigraphic and archaeological discoveries, The Emperor Domitian proposes that Domitian was a ruthless but efficient autocrat with a sound foreign policy, and rejects the traditional view that dismisses him as a vicious tyrant. His harshness was felt by a comparatively minute, but highly vocal section of the population, who included those who wrote the history of his reign.; Brian Jones argues that his relationship with the court rather than with the senate is central to understanding his policies and in explaining his reputation. The book further challenges many of the assumptions concerning Domitian's connection with the persecution of the early Christians. Domitian remains one of the most important and intriguing of the Roman rulers. Roman historians will have to take account of this new biography which in part represents a rehabilitation of Domitian.",N/A,N/A,en

The Routledge Handbook of Tourism Marketing,['Scott McCabe'],2017-05-18,['Marketing'],"Tourism has often been described as being about ¿selling dreams¿, tourist experiences being conceptualized as purely a marketing confection, a socially constructed need. However, the reality is that travel for leisure, business, meetings, sports or visiting loved ones has grown to be a very real sector of the global economy, requiring sophisticated business and marketing practices. The Routledge Handbook of Tourism Marketing explores and critically evaluates the current debates and controversies inherent to the theoretical, methodological and practical processes of marketing within this complex and multi-sector industry. It brings together leading specialists from range of disciplinary backgrounds and geographical regions to provide reflection and empirical research on this complex relationship. The Handbook is divided in to nine inter-related sections: Part 1 deals with shifts in the context of marketing practice and our understanding of what constitutes value for tourists; Part 2 explores macromarketing and tourism; Part 3 deals with strategic issues; Part 4 addresses recent advances in research; Part 5 focuses on developments in tourist consumer behaviour; Part 6 looks at micromarketing; Part 7 moves on to destination marketing and branding issues; Part 8 looks at the influence of technological change on tourism marketing; and Part 9 explores future directions. This timely book offers the reader a comprehensive synthesis of this sub-discipline, conveying the latest thinking and research. It will provide an invaluable resource for all those with an interest in tourism and marketing, encouraging dialogue across disciplinary boundaries and areas of study.

Confessions of the Pricing Man,['Hermann Simon'],2015-10-20,['Business & Economics'],"The world’s foremost expert on pricing strategy shows how this mysterious process works and how to maximize value through pricing to company and customer. In all walks of life, we constantly make decisions about whether something is worth our money or our time, or try to convince others to part with their money or their time. Price is the place where value and money meet. From the global release of the latest electronic gadget to the bewildering gyrations of oil futures to markdowns at the bargain store, price is the most powerful and pervasive economic force in our day-to-day lives and one of the least understood. The recipe for successful pricing often sounds like an exotic cocktail, with equal parts psychology, economics, strategy, tools and incentives stirred up together, usually with just enough math to sour the taste. That leads managers to water down the drink with hunches and rules of thumb, or leave out the parts with which they don’t feel comfortable. While this makes for a sweeter drink, it often lacks the punch to have an impact on the customer or on the business. It doesn’t have to be that way, though, as Hermann Simon illustrates through dozens of stories collected over four decades in the trenches and behind the scenes. A world-renowned speaker on pricing and a trusted advisor to Fortune 500 executives, Simon’s lifelong journey has taken him from rural farmers’ markets, to a distinguished academic career, to a long second career as an entrepreneur and management consultant to companies large and small throughout the world. Along the way, he has learned from Nobel Prize winners and leading management gurus, and helped countless managers and executives use pricing as a way to create new markets, grow their businesses and gain a sustained competitive advantage. He also learned some tough personal lessons about value, how people perceive it, and how people profit from it. In this engaging and practical narrative, Simon leaves nothing out of the pricing cocktail, but still makes it go down smoothly and leaves you wanting to learn more and do more—as a consumer or as a business person. You will never look at pricing the same way again.",5,N/A,en

Meatball Sundae,['Seth Godin'],2024-04-04,['Business & Economics'],"How to match the right marketing approach to your product, by legendary business thinker Seth Godin. The shiny new marketing technique isn't necessarily the right one to use. According to bestselling author Seth Godin, these new-fangled tactics can be like the toppings at an ice cream parlour. If you start with ice cream, adding cherries and hot fudge and whipped cream will make it taste great. But if you start with a bowl of meatballs . . . yuck! As traditional marketing fades away, the new tools seem irresistible. But they don't work as well for boring brands (meatballs?) that might still be profitable but don't attract word of mouth, such as Cheerios, Ford trucks, Barbie dolls or Budweiser. When Anheuser-Busch spends $40 million on an online network called BudTV, that's a meatball sundae. It leads to no new Bud drinkers, just a bad case of indigestion. Meatball Sundae is the definitive guide to the fourteen trends no marketer can afford to ignore. It explains what to do about the increasing power of stories, not facts; about shorter and shorter attention spans; and about the new math that says five thousand people who want to hear your message are more valuable than five million who don't. The winners aren't just annoying start-ups run by three teenagers who never had a real job. You'll also meet older companies that have adapted brilliantly, such as Blendtec, a thirty-year-old blender maker. It now produces 'Will it blend?' videos that demolish golf balls, Coke cans, iPhones and much more. For a few hundred dollars, Blendtec reached more than ten million eager viewers on YouTube. Godin doesn't pretend that it's easy to get your products, marketing messages and internal systems in sync. But he'll convince you that it's worth the effort.",N/A,N/A,en

The Daily You,['Joseph Turow'],2012-01-10,['Social Science'],"The Internet is often hyped as a means to enhanced consumer power: a hypercustomized media world where individuals exercise unprecedented control over what they see and do. That is the scenario media guru Nicholas Negroponte predicted in the 1990s, with his hypothetical online newspaper The Daily Me—and it is one we experience now in daily ways. But, as media expert Joseph Turow shows, the customized media environment we inhabit today reflects diminished consumer power. Not only ads and discounts but even news and entertainment are being customized by newly powerful media agencies on the basis of data we don’t know they are collecting and individualized profiles we don’t know we have. Little is known about this new industry: how is this data being collected and analyzed? And how are our profiles created and used? How do you know if you have been identified as a “target” or “waste” or placed in one of the industry’s finer-grained marketing niches? Are you, for example, a Socially Liberal Organic Eater, a Diabetic Individual in the Household, or Single City Struggler? And, if so, how does that affect what you see and do online?Drawing on groundbreaking research, including interviews with industry insiders, this important book shows how advertisers have come to wield such power over individuals and media outlets—and what can be done to stop it.",N/A,N/A,en
Aaker on Branding,['David Aaker'],2014-07-15,['Business & Economics'],"""Aaker on Branding"" presents in a compact form the twenty essential principles of branding that will lead to the creation of strong brands. Culled from the six David Aaker brand books and related publications, these principles provide the broad understanding of brands, brand strategy, brand portfolios, and brand building that all business, marketing, and brand strategists should know. ""Aaker on Branding"" is a source for how you create and maintain strong brands and synergetic brand portfolios. It provides a checklist of strategies, perspectives, tools, and concepts that represents not only what you should know but also what action options should be on the table. When followed, these principles will lead to strong, enduring brands that both support business strategies going forward and create coherent and effective brand families. Those now interested in and involved with branding are faced with information overload, not only from the Aaker books but from others as well. It is hard to know what to read and which elements to adapt. There are a lot of good ideas out there but also some that are inferior, need updating, or are subject to being misinterpreted and misapplied. And there are some ideas that, while plausible, are simply wrong if not dangerous especially if taken literally. ""Aaker on Branding""offers a sense of topic priorities and a roadmap to David Aaker's books, thinking, and contributions. As it structures the larger literature of the brand field, it also advances the theory of branding and the practice of brand management and, by extension, the practice of business management.",N/A,N/A,en

For additional information about the Berry-AMA Book Prize, visit Berry-AMA Book Prize. Why do some people drink black coffee and others stick to tea? Why do some people prefer competitors’ products? Why do we sell less in this country? Many companies fail to acknowledge and analyze disparities observed among customers and simply put them down to culture or emotion. New neuroendocrinological research proves that consumers are rational: They just have a different biological perception of the same stimulus! Their preferences, behavior, and decisions are strongly influenced by the hundredsof millions of sensors monitoring their body and brain. People with more taste buds are for example sensitive to bitterness and are more likely to drink their coffee with sugar or milk, or to drink tea. After reading the book, managers will be able to: • Understand and predict consumers’ behavior and preferences • Design the right sensory mix (color, shape, taste, smell, texture, and sound) for each product • Fine-tune their positioning and product range for every local market • Systematically increase their innovation hit rate",2.5,N/A,en

The One to One Future,"['Don Peppers', 'Martha Rogers']",1997,['Business & Economics'],"The One to One Future revolutionized marketing when it was first published.

Now finally available in paperback, this completely revised and updated edition--with an all-new User's Guide--takes readers step-by-step through the latest strategies needed for any business to compete, and succeed, in the Interactive Age. Most businesses follow time-honored mass-marketing rules of pitching their products to the greatest number of people. However, selling more goods to fewer people is not only more efficient but far more profitable. The One to One Future is a radically innovative business paradigm focusing on the share of customer--one customer at a time--rather than just the share of market. Authors Don Peppers and Martha Rogers reveal one to one strategies to: * Find the 20 percent--or 2 percent--of your own customers and prospects who are the most loyal and who offer the biggest opportunities for future profit; * Collaborate with each customer, one at a time, just as you now work with individual suppliers or marketing partners; * Nurture your relationships with each customer by relying on new one to one media vehicles--not just the mail, but the fax machine, the touch-tone phone, voice mail, cell phones, and interactive television. Leading-edge companies such as MCI, Lexus, Levi Strauss, and Nissan Canada, and thousands of smaller enterprises, have already adopted the one-to-one perspective.

A mash-up of the best elements of Crush It! and The Thank You Economy with a fresh spin, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hookis a blueprint to social media marketing strategies that really works. When managers and marketers outline their social media strategies, they plan for the “right hook”—their next sale or campaign that’s going to knock out the competition. Even companies committed to jabbing—patiently engaging with customers to build the relationships crucial to successful social media campaigns—want to land the punch that will take down their opponent or their customer’s resistance in one blow. Right hooks convert traffic to sales and easily show results. Except when they don’t. Thanks to massive change and proliferation in social media platforms, the winning combination of jabs and right hooks is different now. Vaynerchuk shows that while communication is still key, context matters more than ever. It’s not just about developing high-quality content, but developing high-quality content perfectly adapted to specific social media platforms and mobile devices—content tailor-made for Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and Tumblr.",N/A,N/A,en

The Idea Writers,['Teressa Iezzi'],2010-12-07,['Business & Economics'],"This book is a must read for any copywriter and anyone looking to understand the new realities of the brand creativity business. A memorable slogan has been the cornerstone of every great ad campaign. In the past, writing one great headline could launch a career. But today's advertising campaigns are interactive, multi-platform and ongoing, and the copywriter's canvas is vast. At any given time, a copywriter may be conceiving a video game, writing a TV show, maintaining a Twitter feed, creating a mobile app or an interactive installation or, yes, writing a headline or a TV script. While the best copywriters have always been brand storytellers, now that story can play out anywhere. The digital revolution put control in the hands of the people - the audience - now no longer just consumers, but active participants in a brand's story. The art and science of advertising has gone from creating one-way messages to engaging audiences in ongoing conversations. A new ad landscape means new opportunities for writers who now have the incredible opportunity to push brand narrative to places it's never been before and to actually create something so useful or entertaining that it generates its own audience. It also means that many of the rules of the past - while exceedingly worthy of study - are insufficient to guide the modern copywriter. Co-published with AdvertisingAge, The Idea Writers outlines the changing landscape of the advertising industry while providing useful how-to advice.

Introduction: The Meaning and Scope of Marketing JL ISTRIBUTION, or marketing is the most important part of business. Most business concerns can produce many more goods than they can sell at a profit. Give us sales is the common cry of businessmen, and huge sums are spent on ad vertising and salesmanship. Whatever can be sold can be made. The big problem is distribution. Such statements are common and may be accepted as generally true in normal times. This condition has not always existed. Up until compara tively recent times, the big task of the race was to produce enough goods food, clothing, and shelterto satisfy its needs. During the past 150 years the problem has been altered by the use of labor-saving machinery by the discoveries and inventions of chemistry, agriculture, physics, and engineering and by the development of scientific management and accounting. The development of the natural sciences and the arts of physics, entomology, geology, chemistry, management, and en gineering has given us much new knowledge which has enabled us to increase greatly the output of goods and to reduce the costs of production. The result is that usually we are able to produce many more goods than the consumers are able to buy at the prevailing prices. Hence businessmen and farmers have become greatly interested in distribution...",N/A,N/A,en

Why We Buy,['Paco Underhill'],1999,['Consumer behavior'],"Shopping: there's a lot more to it if you know how to look. We speed up when we walk past a bank (nothing to look at, of course), so if you don't want your customers to shoot straight past you, don't open your shop next to a bank. And once you've lured them in, whatever you do, don't put key items just inside the door. This is decompression zone where we take the five to 15 paces we need to adjust to the shop's lighting and slow down from normal walking pace to browsing. And don't ever put menswear at the back of the shop; male customers don't like having to walk through womenswear. And while we're in womenswear, don't place goods that require close scrutiny in narrow aisles. Your female customers will leave if they are brushed or knocked by passing shoppers. profitable.

Hence, it reveals that consumers utilize mental accounting processes different from those assumed in marketers' logical inferences when it comes to time, problems with rating and choosing, and in post-purchase evaluation. People are often guided by illusions not only when they perceive the outside world but also when planning their actions - and consumer behavior is no exception. Strengthening the control over their own desires and the ability to navigate the maze of data are crucial skills consumers can gain to benefit themselves, marketers and the public. Understanding the mind of the consumer is the hardest task faced by business researchers.
