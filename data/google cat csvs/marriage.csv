The Age of Innocence,['Edith Wharton'],2006-02-09,['Fiction'],"Edith Wharton's most famous novel, written immediately after the end of the First World War, is a brilliantly realized anatomy of New York society in the 1870s. The charming Newland Archer is content to live within its constraints until he meets Ellen Olenska, whose arrival threatens his impending marriage as well as his comfortable future. - ;'They lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs.' Edith Wharton's most famous novel, written immediately after the end of the First World War, is a brilliantly realized anatomy of New York society in the 1870s, the world in which she grew up, and from which she spent her life escaping. Newland Archer, Wharton's protagonist, charming, tactful, enlightened, is a thorough product of this society; he accepts its standards and abides by its rules but he also recognizes its limitations. His engagement to the impeccable May Welland assures him of a safe and conventional future, until the arrival of May's cousin Ellen Olenska puts all his plans in jeopardy. Independent, free-thinking, scandalously separated from her husband, Ellen forces Archer to question the values and assumptions of his narrow world. As their love for each other grows, Archer has to decide where his ultimate loyalty lies. -",N/A,N/A

"The Oriental, the Ancient and the Primitive",['Jack Goody'],1990-02-08,['Reference'],"Continuing the comparative survey of pre-industrial family formation undertaken in The Development of Family and Marriage in Europe (1983), Professor Goody looks in depth at kinship practice in Asia. His findings cause him to question many traditional assumptions about the ""primitive"" East, and he suggests that, in contrast to pre-colonial Africa, kinship practice in Asia has much in common with that prevailing in parts of pre-industrial Europe. Goody examines the transmission of productive and other property in relation both to the prevailing political economy and to family and ideological structures, and explores the distribution of mechanisms and strategies of management across cultures. The book concludes that notions of western ""uniqueness"" are often misplaced, and that much previous work on Asian kinship has been unwittingly distorted by the application of concepts and approaches derived from other, inappropriate, social formations.",N/A,N/A

Middlemarch,['George Eliot'],2011,['England'],"The Penguin English Library Edition of Middlemarch by George Eliot 'She did not know then that it was Love who had come to her briefly as in a dream before awaking, with the hues of morning on his wings - that it was Love to whom she was sobbing her farewell as his image was banished by the blameless rigour of irresistible day' George Eliot's most ambitious novel is a masterly evocation of diverse lives and changing fortunes in a provincial community. Peopling its landscape are Dorothea Brooke, a young idealist whose search for intellectual fulfillment leads her into a disastrous marriage to the pedantic scholar Casaubon; the charming but tactless Dr Lydgate, whose marriage to the spendthrift beauty Rosamund and pioneering medical methods threaten to undermine his career; and the religious hypocrite Bulstrode, hiding scandalous crimes from his past.

The Physiology of Marriage,['Honoré de Balzac'],1997,['Fiction'],"It is well known that Balzac had two literary careers--the first, under a pseudonym, writing blood-and-thunder romance novels and the second, under his own name, as the creator of La Comedie Humaine, the vast chronicle of ""contemporary life in all its complexity."" But, in between these outpourings of fiction, he wrote a work of nonfiction--The Physiology of Marriage--that brought him his first fame as a writer and introduced his now familiar worldview in which passion is held in check by social advantage and blind innocence is the greatest danger to well-being. As forgotten today as Stendhal's much more ardent On Love is renown, The Physiology of Marriage coolly examines the economics and power relationships of seduction and love. Balzac proposes that marriage and the selection of a wife be treated as a science, and examines topics ranging from moral education to methods for foiling adulterous relationships. For all of its apparent misogyny, the Physiology is surprisingly evenhanded in its rough treatment of both men and women (and is said to have been written with the collaboration of two women). Though addressed to a male audience, the book's lively attack on the stale institution of marriage made it most popular with women readers of its day. ""'Policy' in marriage consists of taking advantage of all opportunities offered by the laws, by the system of our morals, by force, and by cunning, for preventing your wife from doing the three things that practically constitute the life of love: writing to her lover, seeing him, and speaking to him.""--from The Physiology of Marriage",N/A,N/A

Bridgerton [TV Tie-In],['Julia Quinn'],2020-12,['Fiction'],"From New York Times bestselling author Julia Quinn comes the first novel in the beloved Regency-set world of her charming, powerful Bridgerton family, now a series created by Shonda Rhimes for Netflix. In the ballrooms and drawing rooms of Regency London, rules abound. From their earliest days, children of aristocrats learn how to address an earl and curtsey before a prince--while other dictates of the ton are unspoken yet universally understood. A proper duke should be imperious and aloof. A young, marriageable lady should be amiable...but not too amiable. Daphne Bridgerton has always failed at the latter. The fourth of eight siblings in her close-knit family, she has formed friendships with the most eligible young men in London. Everyone likes Daphne for her kindness and wit. But no one truly desires her. She is simply too deuced honest for that, too unwilling to play the romantic games that captivate gentlemen. Amiability is not a characteristic shared by Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings. Recently returned to England from abroad, he intends to shun both marriage and society--just as his callous father shunned Simon throughout his painful childhood.

The Delights of Wisdom on the Subject of Conjugial Love,['Emanuel Swedenborg'],1996,['Love'],"Excerpt: ...the learned; for thereby we discover what influx is, and what it effects. By influx we mean all that which precedes, and constitutes what follows, and by things following in order constitutes what is last; as all that which precedes with a man, and constitutes his wisdom; or all that which precedes with a statesman, and constitutes his political skill; or all that which precedes with a theologian, and constitutes his erudition; in like manner all that which proceeds from infancy, and constitutes a man; also what proceeds in order from a seed and a twig, and makes a tree, and afterwards what proceeds from a blossom, and makes its fruit; in like manner all that which precedes and proceeds with a bridegroom and bride, and constitutes their marriage: this is the meaning of influx. That all those things which precede in minds form series, which collect together, one next to another, and one after another, and that these together compose a last or ultimate, is as yet unknown in the world; but as it is a truth from heaven, it is here adduced for it explains what influx effects, and what is the quality of the last or ultimate, in which the above-mentioned series successively formed co-exist. From these considerations it may be seen that the states of the minds of each of the parties proceeding in successive order flow into the state of marriage. But married partners after marriage are altogether ignorant of the successive things which are insinuated into, and exist in their minds (animis) from things antecedent; nevertheless it is those things which give form to conjugial love, and constitute the state of their minds; from which state they act the one with the other. The reason why one state is formed from one order with such as are spiritual, and from another with such as are natural, is, because the spiritual proceed in a just order, and the natural in an unjust order; for the spiritual look to the Lord, and the Lord provides and leads the order; whereas...",N/A,N/A

The Valley of the Moon,['Jack London'],2021-05-07,[],"The Valley of the Moon (1913) is a novel by American writer Jack London. Inspired by his experiences as a working-class man and dedicated socialist, London incorporates aspects of his own biography--his interest in sailing, his life on a ranch in Sonoma County--to tell a story of hardship, hope, and perseverance. Having grown disillusioned with the labor movement, London uses the novel to advocate for sustainable agriculture and other alternatives to industry, urban life, and modernization. A former professional boxer, Billy works as a Teamster in Oakland, where strikes and demonstrations for the labor movement often turn violent. Soon after his marriage to Saxon, a young laundry worker, Billy is arrested for assaulting a strikebreaker, the stress of which contributes to his wife's miscarriage. When he is released from jail, Saxon convinces him to reject the labor movement, and the two embark on a journey north to look for work and a new life away from the city. On the way, they meet immigrant farmers who instruct them in the ways of sustainable farming, briefly join an artists' colony, and befriend a young journalist and his wife. After winning a substantial amount of money in a boxing match, Billy purchases a team of horses and envisions a life of prosperity and safety with which to start a family. The Valley of the Moon, though relatively unsuccessful at the time of its publication, is a meditative work that illuminates the disparities of the American Dream and provides alternatives without succumbing to despair. In its pages, we see the prototype for such authors as John Steinbeck and Jack Kerouac, visionaries and restless souls who refused to accept that life was impossible to change. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Jack London's The Valley of the Moon is a classic of American literature reimagined for modern readers.",N/A,N/A

Modern Love,['David Shumway'],2003-08,['Family & Relationships'],"“My ideas of romance came from the movies,” said Woody Allen, and it is to the movies—as well as to novels, advice columns, and self-help books—that David Shumway turns for his history of modern love. Modern Love argues that a crisis in the meaning and experience of marriage emerged when it lost its institutional function of controlling the distribution of property, and instead came to be seen as a locus for feelings of desire, togetherness, and loss. Over the course of the twentieth century, partly in response to this crisis, a new language of love—“intimacy”—emerged, not so much replacing but rather coexisting with the earlier language of “romance.” Reading a wide range of texts, from early twentieth-century advice columns and their late twentieth-century antecedent, the relationship self-help book, to Hollywood screwball comedies, and from the “relationship films” of Woody Allen and his successors to contemporary realist novels about marriages, Shumway argues that the kinds of stories the culture has told itself have changed. Part layperson’s history of marriage and romance, part meditation on intimacy itself, Modern Love will be both amusing and interesting to almost anyone who thinks about relationships (and who doesn’t?).",N/A,N/A

"Philosophy of Love, Sex, and Marriage",['Raja Halwani'],2018,['Love'],"How is love different from lust or infatuation? Do love and marriage really go together ""like a horse and carriage""? Does sex have any necessary connection to either? And how important are love, sex, and marriage to a well-lived life? In the Second Edition of this lively, lucid, and comprehensive book, Raja Halwani explores and elucidates the nature, uses, and ethics of romantic love, sexuality, and marriage. It is structured in three parts: Love examines the nature of romantic love and how it differs from other types of love, such as friendship and parental love. It also investigates the relationship of love to morality and asks what limits morality puts on romantic love and even whether romantic love is inherently moral. Sex demonstrates the difficulty in defining sex and the sexual, and examines what constitutes good and bad sex in terms of pleasure, ""naturalness,"" and moral permissibility. It discusses the nature of sexual desire and its connection to objectification and virtue, all the while looking at specific sexual engagements such as pornography, BDSM, and raced desires. Marriage traces the history of the institution and describes the various forms in which marriage exists and the reasons why people marry. It also investigates the necessity of marriage and ways in which it requires reform. Updates and Revisions in the Second Edition Expands the coverage of love and morality from one to two chapters, incorporating much of the recent literature on love as a moral emotion. Includes a new chapter on sex and virtue ethics. Ends each of the chapters on sex with an ""applied"" topic, such as pornography, BDSM, prostitution, racial sexual desires, and adultery. Increases coverage of the nature and purpose of marriage, including debates surrounding same-sex marriage, but also moving beyond these debates to include issues on minimal marriage, temporary marriage, polygamy, and other forms of marriage. Updates the Further Reading and Study Questions sections at the end of each chapter and provides an up-to-date comprehensive bibliography at the back of the book. Includes new discussions of topics on the nature of love; love and reasons; distinctions between two types of romantic love; love and its connections to moral theories; definitions of crucial sexual concepts; objectification; virtue and sex; racial sexual desires; and the definition of marriage and whether it is important as an institution.",N/A,N/A

This is the kind of insight that makes The Age of Innocence so indispensable. Wharton's story of the upper classes of Old New York, and Newland Archer's impossible love for the disgraced Countess Olenska, is a perfectly wrought book about an era when upper-class culture in the U.S. was still a mixture of American and European extracts, and when society had rules as rigid as any in history.

"The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800",['Lawrence Stone'],1990,['England'],"During the period of 1500 - 1800 there were massive changes in world social and cultural systems, and the family unit as we recognize it today came into being. The emphasis on the individual, the right to personal freeedoms and the desire for privacy developed during this period and were symptomatic of world-wide shifts in attitude that also affected religion and politics. This book is a study of the evolution of the family, from the impersonal, economically bonded and precarious extended family group of the sixteenth century to the smaller, affectively bonded nuclear unit that had appeared by the end of the eighteenth century, and shows how this process radically influenced child-rearing, education, contraception, sexual behaviour and marriage.

Large Print book.NORTHANGER ABBEY is the story of seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland, one of ten children of a country clergyman, who imagines life as living in one of the Gothic novels with which she is excessively fond of reading. When she is invited by her wealthy neighbors, the Fullertons, to accompany them to the spa town of Bath she experiences her first taste of the fashionable upper-class society of England.Catherine meets the clever young gentleman, Henry Tilney, his sister Eleanor, and their father, the imposing General Tilney. The Tilneys invite Catherine to come stay with them at their estate, the titular Northanger Abbey. Catherine's naïve over-active imagination quickly leads to embarrassment when she infers some sinister circumstances regarding the lack of emotion that General Tilney shows for the loss of his deceased wife.Eventually Catherine realizes that real life is not at all like that of a Gothic novel. Noted for the insight it gives to Austen's one opinions of the literature of her day, ""Northanger Abbey"" is both a satirical parody of the gothic romance novel and the story of a young girl's maturation into womanhood.First published posthumously in 1817, ""Northanger Abbey"" was actually the first finished novel that Jane Austen wrote.",N/A,N/A

Ria Lavender is the last woman in the world to be swept away by a smooth line and a seductive smile. Talented, sophisticated, and determined, she's carved out a place for herself in the most prestigious architectural firm in the city. And she's just beginning to savor the fruits of her success when she meets a man who will change everything. Mayor-Elect Taylor MacKensie is handsome, charming, and charismatic. Still, Ria never imagines that she'll leave a Christmas party with him, or that, caught up in the magic of a snowfall and a bottle of champagne, she'll give in to desire. But the next morning she faces the stunning truth: she's slept with a man she barely knows. And that's not the only surprise in store: eight weeks later, Ria knows she's carrying Taylor MacKensie's child. Desperate to spare her baby the pain and stigma of illegitimacy, Ria makes the only decision she can. Somehow she must persuade Taylor MacKensie to agree to a temporary marriage. Yet how do you propose marriage to a relative stranger? How do you tell him you're carrying his child? And how do you react when he meets your news with anger and disbelief? Within hours, Taylor's outrage cools and he insists that they marry immediately. Suddenly Ria is sharing his house, his name, and something infinitely more dangerous to her heart...a tenderness she never expected, a passion she can't seem to control. But afraid that Taylor's motives have more to do with protecting his career--and his baby--than with his feelings for her, Ria will try her best to keep her distance...until the day tragedy strikes and teaches them both a lesson in miracles--and love.

Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions,['S©ıren Kierkegaard'],1993,['Family & Relationships'],"Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions was among seven signed works by Kierkegaard, each published concurrently with one of his seven pseudonymous works - in this case, with Stages on Life's Way. The two volumes not only have a chronological relation but distinctively treat some common themes. It is quite possible, the editors suggest, that Kierkegaard worked alternatively on the two manuscripts: on Stages at his ordinary desk and on Discourses on Imagined Occasions at his high desk. The first of the three discourses, ""On the Occasion of a Confession"", centers on stillness, wonder, and the ultimate object of a human being's seeking - in contrast to the speechmaking on erotic love in ""'In Vino Veritas, '"" part one of Stages. The second discourse, ""On the Occasion of a Wedding"", complements the second part of Stages in which Judge William delivers a panegyric on marriage. The third discourse, ""At a Graveside"", sharpens the ethical and religious earnestness implicit in Quidam's ""A Story of Suffering"", in the third part of the other work.",5,N/A

The New Testament on Sexuality,['William Loader'],2012-09-13,['Psychology'],"This is the fifth and final installment of William Loader's authoritative, acclaimed series on attitudes toward sexuality in the ancient world. Sexual themes are never far beneath the surface where there are human beings. This was certainly the case for Christians in the first-century world. Some began in a strongly Jewish context and worked out their faith in dialogue with their scriptural heritage. Others had to work out their sexual ethics in a world strongly influenced by Greco-Roman ideals and practices. In The New Testament on Sexuality William Loader explores the relevant cultural contexts and looks at New Testament texts related to sexuality, highlighting both the warnings about sexual wrongdoing and the affirmations of sexual union. He deals with specific themes such as divorce, same-sex relations, women and men in leadership, and celibacy; individual behavior, gender roles and rules, preferences, and hopes also fall under the scope of his investigation. Broad-ranging and thorough, this book engages both the biblical texts and the diverse ways in which they have been interpreted.",N/A,N/A

It was a very small shop, in a shabby basement, in a side-street already doomed to decline; and from the miscellaneous display behind the window-pane, and the brevity of the sign surmounting it (merely ""Bunner Sisters"" in blotchy gold on a black ground) it would have been difficult for the uninitiated to guess the precise nature of the business carried on within.

Things I Wish I'd Known Before We Got Married,['Gary D.

No wonder the divorce rate hovers around fifty percent. Bestselling author and marriage counselor Gary Chapman hopes to change that with his newest book. Gary, with more than 35 years of experience counseling couples, believes that divorce is the lack of preparation for marriage and the failure to learn the skills of working together as intimate teammates. So he put together this practical little book, packed with wisdom and tips that will help many develop the loving, supportive and mutually beneficial marriage men and women long for. It's the type of information Gary himself wished he had before he got married. The material lends itself to heart-felt discussions by dating or engaged couples. To jump-start the exchanges, each short chapter includes insightful ""Talking it Over"" questions and suggestions. And, the book includes information on interactive websites as well as books that will enhance the couples experience. Dr. Chapman even includes a thought-provoking appendix. By understanding and balancing the five key aspects of life, dating couples can experience a healthy relationship. A revealing learning exercise is included at the end.",N/A,N/A
