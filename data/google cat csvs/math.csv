Basic Technical Mathematics with Calculus,['Allyn J. Washington'],1978,['Mathematics'],"A textbook intended primarily for students in technical and pre- engineering technology programs or other programs for which coverage of basic mathematics is required. There is an integrated treatment of mathematical topics, from algebra to calculus, with numerous applications from many fields of technology to indicate where and how mathematical techniques are used. For this edition (fifth was 1990), most sections have been rewritten to some degree to include additional or revised explanatory material, examples, and exercises.

Life of Fred,['Stanley Fredric Schmidt'],2007,['Mathematics'],"""This is the last arithmetic book. After you finish the 192 pages of this book you will be ready for algebra. There are 33 chapters. Each chapter is a lesson. Just like Life of Fred: Fractions, after each five chapters you will come to The Bridge, which will give you a chance to show that you know the math before you move on tot he next chapter. The main danger in the Life of Fred books is that the readers enjoy them too much.""--Publisher description.",N/A,N/A,en

Cultivating STEM Identities,['Wendy Ward Hoffer'],2016,['Education'],"""A focus on STEM engages our curiosity, beckons us to marvel, to ask questions, to cultivate childlike wonder, and alongside that a pursuit to understand. This is the joy of STEM."" -Wendy Ward Hoffer STEM content can feel daunting. Many elementary teachers don't yet think of themselves as mathematicians or scientists and lack confidence in their abilities to teach STEM content. Who you are as a teacher informs who your students become. Consciously or unconsciously, your beliefs about STEM impact your behavior and instruction. Wendy Ward Hoffer believes that we can each grow our own confidence and competence as STEM thinker and learners, then intentionally pass these attributes on to our students. With Wendy's guidance, you will learn how to embrace a growth mindset and model the curiosity, persistence, flexibility, and positive regard for STEM needed to design and facilitate rich STEM experiences for all students. Each chapter includes current research findings along with concrete, practical approaches to help you make STEM learning meaningful and to foster students' independence as mathematicians and scientists. We are all scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technology creators and users, making sense of our own worlds every day. Bring positive STEM identities to life in your classroom and watch your students develop the dispositions and habits of mind that will spark bright STEM futures.",N/A,N/A,en

Empowering the Underserved Classroom,['Lorenzo L. Kellam (III)'],2023,['Arts in education'],"""This dissertation follows past research that analyzes and proposes solutions to improve learning outcomes and mitigate educational inequality in America's inner-city and rural public schools. The belief is that in doing so, the affected students are better prepared to succeed socially and economically as adults. After analysis, a public-school students' access and experience with EdTech, highly effective creative pedagogies, and student-centered learning often depend on her parent's income, where she lives, her ethnicity, or her race. If her parents are middle-class and own a home in a middle or upper-class neighborhood, she is much more likely to receive the most effective public education America can provide. If her parents are working-class, newly immigrated, or racial minorities, she often learns in an underserved classroom that provides a sub-standard education and lacks the tools, strategies, and experiences that make learning highly effective. Besides worsening inequality, this reality poses two other possible results. The first is to the underserved child's success as she matriculates through school, and the second is her potential upward mobility.There are, of course, competing ideas for rectifying educational inequality. These fixes include charter schools, vouchers, cultural sensitivity training, privatization, and eliminating teachers' unions, to name a few. However, this essay offers less disruptive approaches that teachers can use in the classroom. The primary argument is a social determinist view of technology which holds that when used as a conduit for instituting creative pedagogies and Inquiry-Based Learning, 21st century education technology (EdTech) web-based platforms can be a valuable tool for mitigating education and technology inequality for underserved students. The direct result is that underserved students receive engaging, well-rounded curricula that inspire them to own their learning while also maximizing their critical and creative thinking skills. Moreover, by becoming Masters of Technology, they are empowered to mobilize upward in American society"" -- Abstract.",N/A,N/A,en
