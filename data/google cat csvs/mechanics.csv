New Foundations for Classical Mechanics,['David Hestenes'],1986-06-30,['Mathematics'],"This is a textbook on classical mechanics at the intermediate level, but its main purpose is to serve as an introduction to a new mathematical language for physics called geometric algebra. Mechanics is most commonly formulated today in terms of the vector algebra developed by the American physicist J. Willard Gibbs, but for some applications of mechanics the algebra of complex numbers is more efficient than vector algebra, while in other applica tions matrix algebra works better. Geometric algebra integrates all these algebraic systems into a coherent mathematical language which not only retains the advantages of each special algebra but possesses powerful new capabilities. This book covers the fairly standard material for a course on the mechanics of particles and rigid bodies. However, it will be seen that geometric algebra brings new insights into the treatment of nearly every topic and produces simplifications that move the subject quickly to advanced levels. That has made it possible in this book to carry the treatment of two major topics in mechanics well beyond the level of other textbooks. A few words are in order about the unique treatment of these two topics, namely, rotational dynamics and celestial mechanics.",N/A,N/A
The Principia: The Authoritative Translation and Guide,"['Isaac Newton', 'Julia Budenz']",2016-02-05,['Science'],"In his monumental 1687 work,ÊPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, known familiarly as theÊPrincipia, Isaac Newton laid out in mathematical terms the principles of time, force, and motion that have guided the development of modern physical science. Even after more than three centuries and the revolutions of Einsteinian relativity and quantum mechanics, Newtonian physics continues to account for many of the phenomena of the observed world, and Newtonian celestial dynamics is used to determine the orbits of our space vehicles. This authoritative, modern translation by I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, the first in more than 285 years, is based on the 1726 edition, the final revised version approved by Newton; it includes extracts from the earlier editions, corrects errors found in earlier versions, and replaces archaic English with contemporary prose and up-to-date mathematical forms. Newton's principles describe acceleration, deceleration, and inertial movement; fluid dynamics; and the motions of the earth, moon, planets, and comets. A great work in itself, theÊPrincipiaÊalso revolutionized the methods of scientific investigation. It set forth the fundamental three laws of motion and the law of universal gravity, the physical principles that account for the Copernican system of the world as emended by Kepler, thus effectively ending controversy concerning the Copernican planetary system. The illuminating Guide to Newton's PrincipiaÊby I. Bernard Cohen makes this preeminent work truly accessible for today's scientists, scholars, and students. Designed with collectors in mind, this deluxe edition has faux leather binding covered with a beautiful dustjacket. Ê",N/A,N/A

A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy,['Anonymous'],2023-10-01,['Science'],"A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy is a significant work by the renowned scientist Sir Isaac Newton himself. In this book, Newton provides a comprehensive overview of his groundbreaking theories and philosophical perspectives that revolutionized the understanding of the physical world. Key Aspects of The Book “A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy: Principia Mathematica: Newton explains the fundamental principles of his landmark work, Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, commonly known as the Principia. He elucidates his laws of motion, universal gravitation, and the mathematical framework that underpins his theories, shaping the foundations of modern physics. Experimental and Deductive Reasoning: Newton emphasizes the importance of empirical observation and rigorous experimentation in scientific inquiry. He highlights the interplay between experimental data and deductive reasoning, illustrating his scientific method and its application in formulating laws and theories. The Nature of Light and Optics: Newton delves into his experiments and theories on the nature of light and optics. He discusses the phenomena of reflection, refraction, and color, providing insights into the behavior of light and the properties of different materials. Through A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy, readers gain a deeper understanding of Newton's profound contributions to the scientific community. From his laws of motion to his investigations into light and optics, the book showcases Newton's intellectual prowess, rigorous scientific approach, and the transformative impact of his discoveries on the field of physics. Sir Isaac Newton: Sir Isaac Newton, an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer, is regarded as one of the greatest scientists in history. Born in 1643, Newton's groundbreaking work in the fields of mechanics and gravitation laid the foundation for classical physics. His seminal work, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, introduced the laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation, transforming our understanding of the physical world. Newton's contributions to mathematics and science revolutionized scientific thought, establishing him as an intellectual giant whose influence continues to shape our understanding of the universe.",N/A,N/A

Low Reynolds number hydrodynamics,"['J. Happel', 'H. Brenner']",1983-09-30,['Science'],"One studying the motion of fluids relative to particulate systems is soon impressed by the dichotomy which exists between books covering theoretical and practical aspects. Classical hydrodynamics is largely concerned with perfect fluids which unfortunately exert no forces on the particles past which they move. Practical approaches to subjects like fluidization, sedimentation, and flow through porous media abound in much useful but uncorrelated empirical information. The present book represents an attempt to bridge this gap by providing at least the beginnings of a rational approach to fluid particle dynamics, based on first principles. From the pedagogic viewpoint it seems worthwhile to show that the Navier-Stokes equations, which form the basis of all systematic texts, can be employed for useful practical applications beyond the elementary problems of laminar flow in pipes and Stokes law for the motion of a single particle. Although a suspension may often be viewed as a continuum for practical purposes, it really consists of a discrete collection of particles immersed in an essentially continuous fluid. Consideration of the actual detailed boundary value problems posed by this viewpoint may serve to call attention to the limitation of idealizations which apply to the overall transport properties of a mixture of fluid and solid particles.",5,N/A

Oscillations and Waves,['Fritz K. Kneubühl'],2013-03-09,['Science'],"In the course of over thirty years of research in various fields of physics and teaching experimental physics to undergraduate and graduate students of physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, chemistry and natural sciences I missed an introductory comprehensive book on the mathematics of linear and nonlinear oscillations and waves from the point of view of physicists and engineers. Oscillations and waves are the playground for all kinds of scientists in spite of the fact that they represent essentially mathematical concepts. In this field, however, the interests of experimentalists and engineers, on one side, and mathematicians, on the other side, usually differ. The latter are most interested and engaged in proofs of general fundamentallaws on the existence and behavior of the solutions of basic differential equations and on the convergence of their approximations, whereas the former need explicit analytical and numerical solutions or approximations, computer programs and graphic displays. In the past decades a gap opened between these two groups with the result that they have difficulties in communicating with each other. This comprehensive book represents a novel attempt to bridge this gap. This book is based on my lecture notes and its predecessor ""Lineare und nichtlineare Schwingungen und Wellen"" published by B. G. Teubner, Stuttgart, FRG, in 1995. The contents of the previous book have been considerably extended, revised and improved thanks to advice from colleagues and co-workers.

Mechanics,['Florian Scheck'],2010-04-01,['Science'],"Purpose and Emphasis. Mechanics not only is the oldest branch of physics but was and still is the basis for all of theoretical physics. Quantum mechanics can hardly be understood, perhaps cannot even be formulated, without a good kno- edge of general mechanics. Field theories such as electrodynamics borrow their formal framework and many of their building principles from mechanics. In short, throughout the many modern developments of physics where one frequently turns back to the principles of classical mechanics its model character is felt. For this reason it is not surprising that the presentation of mechanics re?ects to some - tent the development of modern physics and that today this classical branch of theoretical physics is taught rather differently than at the time of Arnold S- merfeld, in the 1920s, or even in the 1950s, when more emphasis was put on the theoryandtheapplicationsofpartial-differentialequations. Today, symmetriesand invariance principles, the structure of the space–time continuum, and the geom- rical structure of mechanics play an important role. The beginner should realize that mechanics is not primarily the art of describing block-and-tackles, collisions of billiard balls, constrained motions of the cylinder in a washing machine, or - cycle riding.",4,N/A

Newton's Principia for the Common Reader,['Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar'],2003,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica provides a coherent and deductive presentation of his discovery of the universal law of gravitation. It is very much more than a demonstration that 'to us it is enough that gravity really does exist and act according to the laws which we have explained and abundantly serves to account for all the motions of the celestial bodies and the sea'. It is important to us as a model of all mathematical physics.Representing a decade's work from a distinguished physicist, this is the first comprehensive analysis of Newton's Principia without recourse to secondary sources. Professor Chandrasekhar analyses some 150 propositions which form a direct chain leading to Newton's formulation of his universal law of gravitation. In each case, Newton's proofs are arranged in a linear sequence of equations and arguments, avoiding the need to unravel the necessarily convoluted style of Newton's connected prose. In almost every case, a modern version of the proofs is given to bring into sharp focus the beauty, clarity, and breath-taking economy of Newton's methods.Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar is one of the most reknowned scientists of the twentieth century, whose career spanned over 60 years. Born in India, educated at the University of Cambridge in England, he served as Emeritus Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Chicago, where he has was based from 1937 until his death in 1996. His early research into the evolution of stars is now a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, and earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1983. Later work into gravitational interactions between stars, the properties of fluids, magnetic fields, equilibrium ellipsoids, and black holes has earned him awards throughout the world, including the Gold Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society in London (1953), the National Medal of Science in the United States (1966), and the Copley Medal from the Royal Society (1984). His many publications include Radiative transfer (1950), Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability (1961), and The mathematical theory of black holes (1983), each being praised for its breadth and clarity. Newton's Principia for the common reader is the result of Professor Chandrasekhar's profound admiration for a scientist whose work he believed is unsurpassed, and unsurpassable.",N/A,N/A

Mechanical Properties and Testing of Polymers,['G.M. Swallowe'],2013-04-17,['Science'],"This volume represents a continuation of the Polymer Science and Technology series edited by Dr. D. M. Brewis and Professor D. Briggs. The theme of the series is the production of a number of stand alone volumes on various areas of polymer science and technology. Each volume contains short articles by a variety of expert contributors outlining a particular topic and these articles are extensively cross referenced. References to related topics included in the volume are indicated by bold text in the articles, the bold text being the title of the relevant article. At the end of each article there is a list of bibliographic references where interested readers can obtain further detailed information on the subject of the article. This volume was produced at the invitation of Derek Brewis who asked me to edit a text which concentrated on the mechanical properties of polymers. There are already many excellent books on the mechanical properties of polymers, and a somewhat lesser number of volumes dealing with methods of carrying out mechanical tests on polymers. Some of these books are listed in Appendix 1. In this volume I have attempted to cover basic mechanical properties and test methods as well as the theory of polymer mechanical deformation and hope that the reader will find the approach useful.",N/A,N/A
A Modern Approach to Classical Mechanics,['Harald Iro'],2002,['Science'],"The approach to classical mechanics adopted in this book includes and stresses recent developments in nonlinear dynamical systems. The concepts necessary to formulate and understand chaotic behavior are presented. Besides the conventional topics (such as oscillators, the Kepler problem, spinning tops and the two centers problem) studied in the frame of Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics, nonintegrable systems (the Hnon-Heiles system, motion in a Coulomb force field together with a homogeneous magnetic field, the restricted three-body problem) are also discussed. The question of the integrability (of planetary motion, for example) leads finally to the KAM-theorem.This book is the result of lectures on 'Classical Mechanics' as the first part of a basic course in Theoretical Physics. These lectures were given by the author to undergraduate students in their second year at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria. The book is also addressed to lecturers in this field and to physicists who want to obtain a new perspective on classical mechanics.",N/A,N/A

Galileo,['Stillman Drake'],1990-01-01,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Since publication of Stillman Drake?s landmark volume, Galileo at Work: His Scientific Biography, new and exciting information has come to light about this towering figure in the history of Western science. Drawing largely from Galileo?s manuscript working papers, Drake now adds a wealth of detail to the story. Among the findings he presents in this volume are the steps that led to discovery of the pendulum law and the law of fall, by which Galileo opened the road to modern physics; Galileo?s path to the new astronomy of Copernicus, closely linked to his first essays in physics; his subsequent misgivings and final reassurances provided by the telescope. Drake focuses on Galileo?s pioneering work in physics, previously unknown, and shows that time has not diminished its value. He also considers some of the factors that played a part in the development of physics, its classical Greek beginnings, the medieval interlude, the contribution of some of Galileo?s contemporaries, and the resistance of others to his new science of motion. We see in a new light the relation of that science to modern dynamics, created by Newton half a century later. Galileo is better known as an astronomer than as a modern physicist. Drake sheds new light here too as he explores Galileo?s pioneer invention of satellite astronomy, his sighting of Neptune two and one-half centuries before that planet was identified, and his proposal of a cosmogony based on speeds of freely falling bodies. With this book Drake confirms Galileo as the first recognizably modern scientist, in both his methods and results.",N/A,N/A

The three-body problem is one of the oldest problems in science and it is most relevant even in today’s physics and astronomy. The long history of the problem from Pythagoras to Hawking parallels the evolution of ideas about our physical universe, with a particular emphasis on understanding gravity and how it operates between astronomical bodies. The oldest astronomical three-body problem is the question how and when the moon and the sun line up with the earth to produce eclipses. Once the universal gravitation was discovered by Newton, it became immediately a problem to understand why these three-bodies form a stable system, in spite of the pull exerted from one to the other. In fact, it was a big question whether this system is stable at all in the long run. Leading mathematicians attacked this problem over more than two centuries without arriving at a definite answer. The introduction of computers in the last half-a-century has revolutionized the study; now many answers have been found while new questions about the three-body problem have sprung up. One of the most recent developments has been in the treatment of the problem in Einstein’s General Relativity, the new theory of gravitation which is an improvement on Newton’s theory. Now it is possible to solve the problem for three black holes and to test one of the most fundamental theorems of black hole physics, the no-hair theorem, due to Hawking and his co-workers.",N/A,N/A

Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus,"['Ioannis Karatzas', 'Steven Shreve']",2014-03-27,['Mathematics'],"This book is designed as a text for graduate courses in stochastic processes.

The vehicle chosen for this exposition is Brownian motion, which is presented as the canonical example of both a martingale and a Markov process with continuous paths. In this context, the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus is developed. The power of this calculus is illustrated by results concerning representations of martingales and change of measure on Wiener space, and these in turn permit a presentation of recent advances in financial economics (option pricing and consumption/investment optimization).

A Course on Damage Mechanics,['Jean Lemaitre'],2013-12-14,['Science'],"A new branch of science usually develops thus. Somebody publishes the basic ideas. Hesitatingly at first, then little by little, other original contributions appear, until a certain threshold is reached. Then, overview articles are printed, conferences are held, and a first mention is made in textbooks, until specialized monographs are written. Continuum darnage mechanics has reached that status now. To analyze or, if possible, to predict the failure of machine parts or other structures is one of the main goals of engineering science. Consequently fracture mechanics became one of its leading branches. It was based on the analysis of existing cracks. However, especially under conditions of cyclic loading, this might be too late to prevent a disaster. Therefore, the question regarding the precursory state, that is, the evolution of intemal darnage before macrocracks become visible, was then posed. One of the successful approaches to the problern was Weibull's theory which examined, in a statistical manner, the ""weakest link"" in the material volume under consideration. Unfortunately it proved too difficult mathematically to be applied to complicated parts or structures. Therefore it was highly appreciated by the scientific of material community when L. M. Kachanov published in 1958 a simple model darnage which subsequently could be extended to brittle elastic, plastic or viscous materials under all conditions of uniaxial or multiaxial, simple or cyclic loadings, so that it may be considered nearly universal.",N/A,N/A

Probably, we all are as we are due to the accumulation point of a multitude of chance events. Gambling games that have been known to human beings nearly from the beginning of our civilization are based on chance events. These chance events have created the dream that everybody can easily become rich. This pursuit made gambling so popular. This book is devoted to the dynamics of the mechanical randomizers and we try to solve the problem why mechanical device (roulette) or a rigid body (a coin or a die) operating in the way described by the laws of classical mechanics can behave in such a way and produce a pseudorandom outcome. During mathematical lessons in primary school we are taught that the outcome of the coin tossing experiment is random and that the probability that the tossed coin lands heads (tails) up is equal to 1/2. Approximately, at the same time during physics lessons we are told that the motion of the rigid body (coin is an example of suchabody)isfullydeterministic.

In the early 1900s, Albert Einstein formulated two theories that would forever change the landscape of physics: the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity. Respected American academic Professor Tai Chow tells us the story of these discoveries. He details the basic ideas of Einstein, including his law of gravitation. Deftly employing his inimitable writing style, he goes on to explain the physics behind black holes, weaving into his account an explanation of the structure of the universe and the science of cosmology.",N/A,N/A

Elements of Newtonian Mechanics,"['Jens M. Knudsen', 'Poul G. Hjorth']",2012-12-06,['Science'],"In the second edition, a number of misprints that appeared in the first edition have been corrected. In addition to this, we have made improvements based on the experience gathered in the use of the first English edition of the book in the introductory course in physics at the University of Copenhagen. A chapter introducing nonlinear dynamics has been added. The purpose of this chapter is to provide supplementary reading for the students who are interested in this area of active research, where Newtonian mechanics plays an essential role. The students who wish to dig deeper, should consult texts dedicated to the study of nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos. The literature list at the end of this book contains several references for the topic. The book still contains a one-semester (15 weeks) first university course on Newtonian mechanics. This necessarily introduces some constraints on the choice of topics and the level of mathematical sophistication expected from the reader. If one looks for discussions of technical issues, such as the physics behind various manifestations of friction, or the tensorial nature of the rotation vector, one will look in vain. The book contains what we feel are the essential aspects of Newtonian Mechanics. It is a pleasure again to thank Springer-Verlag and in particular Dr. H. J. KOisch and the staff at the Heidelberg office for helpfulness and professional collaboration.",N/A,N/A

The Newtonian Revolution,['I. Bernard Cohen'],1980,['Biography & Autobiography'],"This volume presents Professor Cohen's original interpretation of the revolution that marked the beginnings of modern science and set Newtonian science as the model for the highest level of achievement in other branches of science. It shows that Newton developed a special kind of relation between abstract mathematical constructs and the physical systems that we observe in the world around us by means of experiment and critical observation. The heart of the radical Newtonian style is the construction on the mind of a mathematical system that has some features in common with the physical world; this system was then modified when the deductions and conclusions drawn from it are tested against the physical universe. Using this system Newton was able to make his revolutionary innovations in celestial mechanics and, ultimately, create a new physics of central forces and the law of universal gravitation. Building on his analysis of Newton's methodology, Professor Cohen explores the fine structure of revolutionary change and scientific creativity in general. This is done by developing the concept of scientific change as a series of transformations of existing ideas. It is shown that such transformation is characteristic of many aspects of the sciences and that the concept of scientific change by transformation suggests a new way of examining the very nature of scientific creativity.",N/A,N/A
Classical Mechanics with Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control,['Mark Levi'],2014-03-07,['Mathematics'],"This is an intuitively motivated presentation of many topics in classical mechanics and related areas of control theory and calculus of variations. All topics throughout the book are treated with zero tolerance for unrevealing definitions and for proofs which leave the reader in the dark. Some areas of particular interest are: an extremely short derivation of the ellipticity of planetary orbits; a statement and an explanation of the ""tennis racket paradox""; a heuristic explanation (and a rigorous treatment) of the gyroscopic effect; a revealing equivalence between the dynamics of a particle and statics of a spring; a short geometrical explanation of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, and more. In the last chapter, aimed at more advanced readers, the Hamiltonian and the momentum are compared to forces in a certain static problem. This gives a palpable physical meaning to some seemingly abstract concepts and theorems. With minimal prerequisites consisting of basic calculus and basic undergraduate physics, this book is suitable for courses from an undergraduate to a beginning graduate level, and for a mixed audience of mathematics, physics and engineering students. Much of the enjoyment of the subject lies in solving almost 200 problems in this book.",N/A,N/A
Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications,['D.A. Vallado'],2001-06-30,['Technology & Engineering'],"Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications is rapidly becoming the standard astrodynamics reference for those involved in the business of spaceflight. What sets this book apart is that nearly all of the theoretical mathematics is followed by discussions of practical applications implemented in tested software routines. For example, the book includes a compendium of algorithms that allow students and professionals to determine orbits with high precision using a PC. Without a doubt, when an astrodynamics problem arises in the future, it will become standard practice for engineers to keep this volume close at hand and `look it up in Vallado'. While the first edition was an exceptionally useful and popular book throughout the community, there are a number of reasons why the second edition will be even more so. There are many reworked examples and derivations. Newly introduced topics include ground illumination calculations, Moon rise and set, and a listing of relevant Internet sites. There is an improved and expanded discussion of coordinate systems, orbit determination, and differential correction. Perhaps most important is that all of the software routines described in the book are now available for free in FORTRAN, PASCAL, and C. This makes the second edition an even more valuable text and superb reference.",4,N/A

Classical Mechanics,['V. B. Bhatia'],1997,['Reference'],"The book covers the traditional classical mechanics and then introduces nonlinear oscillations and chaos. These subjects, particularly chaos, have become very important in the recent years and are now being included in courses in Physics and elsewhere. Even within classical mechanics subjects such as nearly circular orbits, virial theorem, anharmonic oscillator and precession and nutation of the earth have been included to make the book suit varied requirements. The book can be adopted for foundation courses on classical mechanics at graduate and post-graduate levels in physics, mathematics and astronomy and wherever else classical mechanics may be a requirement.A large number of problems interspersed throughout the text will induce the students to test the knowledge they had acquired before proceeding further. Another important feature is the appendix which contains some computer programs with essential instructions for solving integrals and differential equations and for plotting phase trajectories and strange attractors on the computer screen so that a student could draw these graphs independently.The short biographical sketches of great scientists and mathematicians who made important contributions to the subject might inspire some readers to look up the detailed biographies to gain some insight the way the science develops.",N/A,N/A

Problems and Solutions in Introductory Mechanics,['David J. Morin'],2014,['Mechanics'],"This problem book is ideal for high-school and college students in search of practice problems with detailed solutions. All of the standard introductory topics in mechanics are covered: kinematics, Newton's laws, energy, momentum, angular momentum, oscillations, gravity, and fictitious forces. The introduction to each chapter provides an overview of the relevant concepts. Students can then warm up with a series of multiple-choice questions before diving into the free-response problems which constitute the bulk of the book. The first few problems in each chapter are derivations of key results/theorems that are useful when solving other problems. While the book is calculus-based, it can also easily be used in algebra-based courses. The problems that require calculus (only a sixth of the total number) are listed in an appendix, allowing students to steer clear of those if they wish. Additional details: (1) Features 150 multiple-choice questions and nearly 250 free-response problems, all with detailed solutions. (2) Includes 350 figures to help students visualize important concepts. (3) Builds on solutions by frequently including extensions/variations and additional remarks. (4) Begins with a chapter devoted to problem-solving strategies in physics. (5) A valuable supplement to the assigned textbook in any introductory mechanics course.",N/A,N/A
