In it, George Ponderovo is apprenticed to his Uncle Edward, a dynamic chemist who invents a bogus medicine, Tono-Bungay, and earns a vast fortune. But as he witnesses Edward's spectacular rise, he also contemplates the corrupt English society that allows his uncle to wield so much power.

Mediated Nostalgia,['Ryan Lizardi'],2016-05-15,['History'],"Considering the current rash of film remakes, vintage video game downloads, and box sets of bygone television shows, media today is obsessed with nostalgia. Instead of presenting a past that functions as an adaptive mirror with which we can compare our contemporary situation, the past is instead presented as an individualized version that transfixes us as uncritical citizens of our own culture. Mediated Nostalgia: Individual Memory and Contemporary Mass Media argues that the cultural implication of a cross-media eternal return to nostalgia is an increasing reliance on defining who we are as people and societies by what media we consumed as children. The unblinking eye toward the past knows no progress, or at the very least, does not employ the past to compare and adaptively engage with the present or future. Examining film, literature, television, and video games, Ryan Lizardi tackles the idea of why that strong sense of nostalgia is such a popular tactic for the media industry, and why it is problematic.",N/A,N/A,en

License to Jump!,"['Marit Nybelius', 'Annette R. Hofmann']",2015,['Ski jumping'],"At the 2015 Nordic Ski World Championship in the Swedish resort Falun, the World Championship in women's ski jumping will be conducted. Women's ski jumping did not have a smooth way to become an internationally acknowledged and accepted sport. However, that struggle is no longer discussed. In many European countries women's ski jumping regularly gets TV coverage and the print media covers it in its sports sections. This book aims to give insight into the at least 150-year-history of women's ski jumping from its beginnings until it became an Olympic sport in the 2014 Sochi Games. It shows the struggle and effort of female ski jumpers, coaches, families and others to make this sport internationally recognized and accepted. The chapters reflect a collection of research done by international authors. Due to the accessibility of sources the main focus is on Europe and North America. However, we do not claim to offer a complete history; there are many histories of women's ski jumping, depending on the geographic location. We tried to avoid an overlapping of contents, which was not always possible, because each chapter was to be an entity in itself. In the future, still, bit by bit, little pieces have to be added to the puzzle to gain a complete picture of the evolution of this sport. Although all authors have an academic background in sport history and/or sport sociology and sport media, the book is aimed to appeal to the general public. For all those readers who are interested in more details, footnotes and references are added.",N/A,N/A,en

Multiculturalism and Democracy in North Africa,['Moha Ennaji'],2014,['Social Science'],"Investigating the connections between multiculturalism, minorities, citizenship, and democracy in North Africa, this book argues that multiculturalism in this region- and in the Arab world at large - has reached a significant level in terms of scale and importance. In the rest of the world, there has been a trend - albeit a contested one - toward a greater recognition of minority rights. The Arab world however, particularly North Africa, seems to be an exception to this trend, as Arab states continue to promote highly unitary and homogenizing ideas of nationhood and state unity, whilst discouraging, or even forbidding, minority political mobilization. The central theoretical premise of this book is that North Africa is a multicultural region, where culture is inherently linked to politics, religion, gender, and society, and a place where democracy is gradually taking root despite many political and economic hurdles. Addressing the lacuna in literature on this issue, this book opens new avenues of thought and research on diversity, linking policy based on cultural difference to democratic culture and to social justice. Multiculturalism and Democracy in North Africa will be of use to students and researchers with an interest in Sociology, Cultural Studies, and Political Science more broadly.",N/A,N/A,en

Staging Solidarity,['Tanya Goodman'],2009,['History'],"The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is a modern social drama that enabled the nation's apartheid past to be constructed as a cultural trauma, and by doing so created a new collective narrative of diversity and inclusion. The TRC relied primarily on testimonies from victims and perpetrators of apartheid violence who came forward to tell their stories in a public forum. Rather than simply serving as data for setting the historical record straight, this book shows that it was not only the content of these testimonies but also how these stories were told and what values were attached to them that became significant. Goodman argues that the performative nature of the TRC process effectively designated the past as profane and simultaneously imagined a sacred future community based on democratic idealism and universal solidarity.",N/A,N/A,en

"Emancipation, the Media, and Modernity",['Nicholas Garnham'],2000,['Social Science'],"This book adopts a polemical stance. It approaches the problems raised by the media by way of a set of arguments with the two dominant paradigms now current for thinking about the media-post-modernism and Information Society theory. It argues that the media are important because they raise aset of questions that have been central to social and political theory since the Enlightenment. In a series of probes into different sets of questions raised by the media, the argument of the book focuses on the problem raised by what Kant called the unsocial sociability of human kind. Under whatconditions could autonomous, free individuals live in viable social communities. Or to put it another way what are the related scope for, and limits on, human reason and emancipation.In conducting this argument the book first argues for a necessarily historical perspective. It then goes on to examine the implications for emancipation of seeing the media as cultural industries within the wider systems world of the capitalist market economy; of seeing the media as technologies; ofthe specialisation of intellectual production and of the separation and increasing social distance between the producers and consumers of symbols. It then goes on to argue, against current ethnographic trends in audience research and against the focus on everyday life, for a reinstatement ofinterest in the statistical reality of audiences and effects, and for a recognition through a return to the Hegelian roots of commodity fetishism, and the symbolic interactionist creation of identities, that an active audience can be actively involved in its own domination. The argument then turnsto the problem of how we evaluate the symbolic forms that the media circulate and whether such evaluation can be anything more than a matter of personal taste. It is argued that evaluation is in practice unavoidable and without some standards that are more than just subjective any criticism of themedias performance is impossible. Via an examination of the debate between the sociology of art and aesthetics it argues for the ethical foundations of aesthetic judgement and for the establishment of agreed standards of aesthetic judgement via the discourse ethic that underlies the argument of theentire book. This foregrounding of the discourse ethic then leads on to a discussion of the media and politics. Here the argument is that arguments about the media and politics are at the heart of arguments about politics itself. These arguments focus, it is argued, upon the shifting divisionbetween the public and the private. Here the book returns to the roots of public sphere theory in Rousseaus arguments for the centrality of public spectacle and Kants argument for the centrality of public reason in the practice of democratic politics.",N/A,N/A,en

Media and Formal Cause,"['Marshall McLuhan', 'Eric McLuhan']",2011,['Aesthetics'],"Reviews No one understood causality, whether Aristotelian or electric, like Marshall McLuhan. Now, in Media and Formal Cause, no one reveals understanding of formal cause in the digital environment better than McLuhan's protégé son, Eric. In the foreword, Lance Strate writes that M. McLuhan's Understanding Media was one of the most important books of the 20th century. For anyone who wishes to understand how things truly work, Media and Formal Cause is one of the most important books of the 21st. Arguably formal cause has been the least understood but the most intellectually important of all of Aristotle's four agents or processes of causation. This small volume proffers a large understanding of this formative, previously mysterious level of invisible creation. Three essays by Marshall (one with co-author Barry Nevitt) and a powerful new essay by Eric give new meaning to ye olde cliché, ""like father, like son"". While reading writing that is engaging, encyclopedic, and electric, we discover that formal cause is not what you think... but it is vital to how you think. -Thomas Cooper, Professor of Visual and Media Arts, Emerson College; author of Fast Media/Media Fast In Media and Formal Cause Eric McLuhan updates an important part of his father's work that is often overlooked, the quixotic role of causality in making sense of how new media change the way we construct our environment and our communication. How does novelty cause antiquity? When do effects precede causes? Read on, and you shall find out. -David Rothenberg, Professor of Philosophy and Music, New Jersey Institute of Technology; author of Why Birds Sing and Thousand Mile Song Like his mentor, Gilbert Keith Chesterton, Marshall McLuhan was often accused of indulging in mere paradox. But Media and Formal Cause demonstrates the profound understanding that underlies the work of both Chesterton and McLuhan, the understanding that we live in a paradoxical world. Both McLuhan and Chesterton attempted to jar readers loose from what Cardinal Newman called ""paper logic"" into a recognition of the total situation in which we find ourselves. This very readable and accessible volume should greatly assist new readers of McLuhan and remind long time students of just how challenging and exhilarating his explorations were. -Philip Marchand, author, Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and the Messenger A sage and perceptive quartet of essays which capture and extend a still quintessentially unique way of thinking about media, via patterns and connections that harken to the ancient world and redound to our present and future. -Paul Levinson, Professor of Communication and Media Studies, Fordham University; author of Digital McLuhan, and of New New Media",N/A,N/A,en

Combining in-depth research, interviews with the key players and a gift for story-telling, it is social history of the highest order.Since 1983, the ABC has seen controversial managing directors - David Hill, Jonathan Shier - come and go. There have been fights over funding - ""eight cents a day"" - and charges of bias. There have been both programming triumphs - from Bananas in Pyjamas to Kath & Kim - and accusations of cowardice and dumbing down.Whose ABC? deals with all these events and more. It seeks out the truth of events and breaks new ground. The result is an unfailingly readable narrative that will be seen as a classic of Australian historical writing.",N/A,N/A,en

An Isolated Incident,['Emily Maguire'],2016,['Detective and mystery stories'],"When beautiful 25-year-old Bella Michaels is brutally murdered in the small New South Wales town of Strathdee, the community is stunned and a full investigation gets underway as a media storm descends. Unwillingly thrust into the eye of that storm is Bella's beloved older sister, Chris, a barmaid at the local pub and occasional sex worker, and a woman whose apparent easygoing nature conceals hard-won wisdom and the kind of street-smart only experience can bring. As Chris is plunged into despair and searches for answers, reasons, explanations - anything - that could make even the smallest sense of Bella's death, her ex-husband, friends and neighbours do their best to support her. But as the days tick by with no arrest, Chris's suspicion of those around her grows. Also interested in Chris is May Norman, a young, self-absorbed city journalist, who is determined that Bella's murder will be the story to launch her career. But the longer May spends in Strathdee, the more she feels unable to do the job she was sent to do, yet unwilling to leave until she knows how the story ends. An Isolated Incident is a psychological thriller about everyday violence, the media's obsession with pretty dead girls, the grip of grief and the myth of closure, and the difficulties of knowing the difference between a ghost and a memory, between a monster and a man.",N/A,N/A,en

Does the media reflect awareness of the divide between India and 'Bharat' and how pro-active is it? How far has substance yielded to style? What are the implications of ownership conglomerates, of the advent of TV, of the rise of regional media? All these, amongst other questions, are discussed.More than thirty voices, each with its distinct tone and perspective, reflect the differentiated nature of the media itself: from monolithic corporations to micro-ventures from the grassroots; from papers where news is defined by star power to those for whom journalism is a mission and a newspaper a movement",N/A,N/A,en

Qu'est-ce que l'archéologie des médias ?,['Jussi Parikka'],2018-01-30,[],"Un nouveau champ de recherche s'est ouvert dans les pays anglo-saxons depuis une vingtaine d'années - l'archéologie des média. Ses praticien(ne)s sont aussi bien des universitaires que des artistes, des historiens que des théoriciennes, des chercheuses que des bidouilleurs. Tous ensemble, mais chacun(e) à sa manière, nous invitent à resituer nos média actuels - imprimés, radio, TV, mais aussi smartphones, tablettes et puces RFID - dans le contexte de définitions et de temporalités élargies. Là où l'histoire des média s'attache à rendre compte de la succession qui voit des ""nouveaux média"" remplacer les anciens, l'archéologie des média creuse dans les couches profondes d'où peuvent émerger des nouveautés cachées dans l'ancien, ainsi que les présences souterraines de l'ancien dans le nouveau. En plus de s'intéresser aux bizarreries, aux curiosités, aux avortons qu'écrasent les récits triomphalistes du progrès technique, l'archéologie des média questionne obstinément la matérialité des appareils qui, depuis des millénaires, nous permettent d'enregistrer, transmettre et traiter les données sensibles et informationnelles offertes à notre attention. Ce livre exemplairement transdisciplinaire constitue la première présentation d'ensemble de l'archéologie des média. Il en situe les principaux courants et les enjeux de fond, tout en y apportant une contribution originale et revigorante. Il appelle chercheuses et artistes à contribuer ensemble à une meilleure compréhension des média de demain, appuyée sur une exploration stimulante des couches oubliées sous l'innovation permanente de nos média contemporains.",N/A,N/A,fr

Introduction à la médiologie,['Régis Debray'],2000,['Communication'],"Loin de la sociologie des médias avec laquelle on la confond parfois, la médiologie a pour objet les interactions, passées et présentes, entre technique et culture. Il s'agit de confronter, mieux : réconcilier, ces deux champs traditionnellement et dangereusement opposés. Réflexion sur la trace, l'archive et la mémoire, l'enquête médiologique, qui peut aller de l'histoire ancienne à la nôtre, de l'écriture à Internet, tire au jour les effets symboliques des innovations techniques comme les conditions culturelles des tournants technologiques. Son utilité : faire valoir les impératifs de la transmission face aux urgences de la communication. Réhabiliter la maîtrise des temps longs, que pourrait bientôt compromettre la conquête obsessionnelle des espaces, est devenu un enjeu capital de civilisation. La démarche médiologique, avec d'autres, peut y contribuer. Un domaine d'études en émergence trouve ici sa première mise au point, accompagnée d'un retour critique sur ses présupposés et ses voisinages.

To do so, Queer Slashers draws on horror and slasher scholarship along with queer theory and LGBT history. Slasher scholarship has already considered the ways in which gender plays an important role in the construction of the slasher formula. Much of this work has focused on the representation of women, especially patterns of violence against women. Queer Slashers seeks to make additional observations about the ways in which femininity more broadly, especially the characterization of killers as femme, sissy, trans or non-binary, has been a crucial component in the history of the genre. It argues that the killer and the survivors of the slasher can be read as queer, or non-normative, whereas the primary victims of the slasher often abide normative conventions of culture, including gender and sexuality. Queer Slashers interweaves close readings of slasher media with theoretical conceptions by scholars such as Michael Warner, Eve Sedgwick, and Cathy J. Cohen, which posit queerness as an intersectional political resistance to normativity, including but not limited to LGBT identities. Using LGBT history, Queer Slashers seeks to recognize important historical developments in the social awareness of LGBT identities, including political advocacy such as the homophile movement of the 1950s and gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 70s, as a meaningful context in which the slasher evolves.",N/A,N/A,en

The Ebola Outbreak in West Africa,['Chernoh Alpha M. Bah'],2015,['History'],"In The Ebola Outbreak in West Africa, the award-wining Sierra Leonean journalist, political activist and human rights advocate Chernoh Alpha M. Bah presents an in-depth investigation that challenges the official narrative surrounding the origin and widespread transmission of the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic - one of the most catastrophic human tragedies in the twenty first century. Bah demonstrates with hard evidence that the western narrative, which rashly pinned the origin of the epidemic on a two-year-old boy in a small Guinean village and implicated the backwardness of Africans as the cause for the widespread nature of the outbreak, was neither corroborated nor challenged by Western journalists and the Western academic establishment. He explores why, at the initial stages of the outbreak when thousands of men, women and children were dying, Western media had already settled upon a narrative that blamed and criminalized the victims for the epidemic's explosion. In this groundbreaking text, Bah establishes the West African outbreak as the continuation of a colonial legacy of multinational corporate exploitation, political corruption, and western dehumanization of the African. Glaringly absent from the official narrative, he argues, is how the billions of dollars of foreign corporate investments existing in West Africa's natural resource exploitation and the strategic international military and governmental intelligence interests in the region (including billion-dollar animal-testing and deadly-pathogen laboratory projects) served as the foundations for the outbreak. It is only from within this global context that the conditions of the outbreak and its widespread devastation can be properly understood. Bah's Ebola Outbreak in West Africa illustrates and illuminates the Ebola crises in new and terrifying ways. It is the first indigenous account that presents a holistic and independent investigation into one of the worst human tragedies in recent history.",N/A,N/A,en

Photography and the Contemporary Cultural Condition,['Peter D. Osborne'],2018,['Photography'],"In this book, Osborne demonstrates why and how photography as photography has survived and flourished since the rise of digital processes, when many anticipated its dissolution into a generalized system of audio-visual representations or its collapse under the relentless overload of digital imagery. He examines how photography embodies, contributes to, and even in effect critiques how the contemporary social world is now imagined, how it is made present and how the concept and the experience of the Present itself is produced. Osborne bases his discussions primarily in cultural studies and visual cultural studies. Through an analysis of different kinds of photographic work in distinct contexts, he demonstrates how aspects of photography that once appeared to make it vulnerable to redundancy turn out to be the basis of its survival and have been utilized by much important photographic work of the last three decades.",N/A,N/A,en
