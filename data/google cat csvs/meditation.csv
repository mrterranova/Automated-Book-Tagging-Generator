You are Here,['Thich Nhat Hanh'],2009,['Religion'],"Simple daily practices to help us discover the happiness and freedom of living in the present moment—from the renowned Buddhist monk and best-selling author. Most of Thich Nhat Hanh’s previous books have either provided an overview of the Buddhist path or offered guidance on specific problem areas in our lives, such as love, anger, power, or death. This new book focuses on Buddhist techniques and practices we can use to cut through the busyness and anxieties of daily life and discover the simple happi­ness of living in the present moment.

You Are Here offers a range of mindfulness practices that will help us to root ourselves in the present–“the address of the Buddha,” as he calls it–where we can experience the joys and magic of being alive, under any circumstances. Practices include: mindfulness of breath, mindful walking, deep listening, and mindful speech, as well as practices for healing emotional pain and cultivating love for oneself and others.

Mindfulness,"['J. Mark G. Williams', 'Mark Williams', 'Danny Penman']",2011,['Mind and body therapies'],"THE LIFE-CHANGING BESTSELLER. MINDFULNESS reveals a set of simple yet powerful practices that can be incorporated into daily life to help break the cycle of unhappiness, stress, anxiety and mental exhaustion and promote genuine joie de vivre. It's the kind of happiness that gets into your bones. It seeps into everything you do and helps you meet the worst that life can throw at you with new courage. The book is based on Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). MBCT revolves around a straightforward form of mindfulness meditation which takes just a few minutes a day for the full benefits to be revealed. MBCT has been clinically proven to be at least as effective as drugs for depression and it is recommended by the UK's National Institute of Clinical Excellence - in other words, it works. More importantly it also works for people who are not depressed but who are struggling to keep up with the constant demands of the modern world. MINDFULNESS focuses on promoting joy and peace rather than banishing unhappiness. It's precisely focused to help ordinary people boost their happiness and confidence levels whilst also reducing anxiety, stress and irritability.",5,N/A,en

The Heart of Meditation,"['Dalai Lama XIV Bstan-ʼdzin-rgya-mtsho', 'Dalai Lama']",2016,['RELIGION'],"His Holiness the Dalai Lama provides intimate details on an advanced meditation practice called Dzogchen using a visionary poem by the 19th-century saint Patrul Rinpoche, author of the Buddhist classic Words of My Perfect Teacher. The Dalai Lama deftly connects how training the mind in compassion for other beings is directly related to--and in fact a prerequisite for--the very pinnacle of Buddhist meditation. He presents his understanding, confirmed again and again over millennia, that the cultivation of both compassion and wisdom is absolutely critical to progress in meditation and goes into great depth on how this can be accomplished. While accessible to a beginner, he leads the reader in very fine detail on how to identify innermost awareness--who we really are--how to maintain contact with this awareness, and how to release oneself from the endless stream of our thoughts to let this awareness, always present, become consistently apparent.",N/A,N/A,en

These have played a major role in preserving the knowledge and wisdom of the masters, although in many cases, the identity of the authors and the dates of origin have been lost. As lifelong pursuit, Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming has translated many of these documents and according to him, believes many are incomplete for reasons relating to: forgotten oral secrets, the original authors personal understanding being too narrowly focused, and many documents that have gone missing could help unify Taijiquan theory. In response, his book Taijiquan Theory of Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is an attempt to join the various theories on Taijiquan in one complete text. This book is structured with treaties, songs, and poems, followed by the original Chinese text and interpretations of the passages. Contents include Regulating the body, breath, mind, Qi & spirit Analysis of Jin, pushing hands and sparring Taijiquan's long range and short range fighting strategies The relationship of Jin and Qi The unification of the internal Qi and external physical manifestations of Qi ""Based upon my personal background and understanding, I have tried my best to compile the Taijiquan Theory and practice concepts in this book.
