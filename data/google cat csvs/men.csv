Lieutenant Thomas Glahn roams Norway's northernmost wilds alone, save only for his faithful dog, Aesop. Living out of a rudimentary hut at the edge of a vast forest, Glahn pursues his solitary existence, hunting and fishing, until the strange girl Edvarda comes into his life. Edvarda is the daughter of a merchant in a nearby town and both are strongly attracted to one another, but neither understands the other's love. Glahn becomes overwhelmed by the society of people where Edvarda lives and suffers a series of tragedies during their time together.A new translation by Terence Cave of Hamsun's 1894 novel restores the power and virtuosity of Hamsun's original and includes an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes.",N/A,N/A,en

Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,"['Alfred C. Kinsey', 'Wardell B. Pomeroy', 'Clyde E. Martin']",2023-06-06,['Psychology'],"When first published in 1948, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male encountered a storm of condemnation and acclaim. By unshackling sex research from flawed founding constraints, Kinsey revolutionized it. In this 75th anniversary edition, featuring a new foreword from Judith A. Allen, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male revisits the work of Alfred C. Kinsey and his fellow researchers as they sought to accumulate an objective body of facts regarding sex. Originally an entomologist, Kinsey applied his fieldwork taxonomy methods to human sexuality. With 5,300 research subjects, his undertaking was the largest sex research project of its time, transforming the field. With scientific exactness, Kinsey describes the methodology, sampling, coding, interviewing, and statistical analyses, and then examines factors and sources of sexual outlet. Told through men's experiences of sexuality and reproduction, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male: Anniversary Edition is a remarkable rumination on American society and science in the early 20th century.",N/A,N/A,en

The New Arab Man,['Marcia C. Inhorn'],2012-03-25,['Family & Relationships'],"Middle Eastern Muslim men have been widely vilified as terrorists, religious zealots, and brutal oppressors of women. The New Arab Man challenges these stereotypes with the stories of ordinary Middle Eastern men as they struggle to overcome infertility and childlessness through assisted reproduction. Drawing on two decades of ethnographic research across the Middle East with hundreds of men from a variety of social and religious backgrounds, Marcia Inhorn shows how the new Arab man is self-consciously rethinking the patriarchal masculinity of his forefathers and unseating received wisdoms. This is especially true in childless Middle Eastern marriages where, contrary to popular belief, infertility is more common among men than women. Inhorn captures the marital, moral, and material commitments of couples undergoing assisted reproduction, revealing how new technologies are transforming their lives and religious sensibilities. And she looks at the changing manhood of husbands who undertake transnational ""egg quests""--set against the backdrop of war and economic uncertainty--out of devotion to the infertile wives they love. Trenchant and emotionally gripping, The New Arab Man traces the emergence of new masculinities in the Middle East in the era of biotechnology.",N/A,N/A,en

Are these to be perpetuated in future editions? I hope not'. Joyce's hope was not fulfilled until 1984 when this critical edition of the work appeared, the fruit of seven years textual research by a team of scholars led by Professor Gabler of the University of Munich. They had returned to the original manuscripts, drafts and proofs in order to reconstruct as closely as possible the creative process by which Joyce wrote Ulysses.

Masculinities,"['R. W. Connell', 'Raewyn Connell']",2005,['Body image'],"This is an exciting new edition of R.W. Connell s ground-breaking text, which has become a classic work on the nature and construction of masculine identity. Connell argues that there is not one masculinity, but many different masculinities, each associated with different positions of power. In a world gender order that continues to privilege men over women, but also raises difficult issues for men and boys, his account is more pertinent than ever before. In a substantial new introduction and conclusion, Connell discusses the development of masculinity studies in the ten years since the book s initial publication. He explores global gender relations, new theories, and practical uses of mascunlinity research. Looking to the future, his new concluding chapter addresses the politics of masculinities, and the implications of masculinity research for understanding current world issues. Against the backdrop of an increasingly divided world, dominated by neo-conservative politics, Connell s account highlights a series of compelling questions about the future of human society. This second edition of Connell s classic book will be essential reading for students taking courses on masculinities and gender studies, and will be of interest to students and scholars across the humanities and social sciences.",3.5,N/A,en
The Pickwick Papers,['Charles Dickens'],1905,['Fiction'],"Charles Dickens's satirical masterpiece, ""The Pickwick Papers,"" catapulted the young writer into literary fame when it was first serialized in 1836-37. It recounts the rollicking adventures of the members of the Pickwick Club as they travel about England getting into all sorts of mischief. Laugh-out-loud funny and endlessly entertaining, the book also reveals Dickens's burgeoning interest in the parliamentary system, lawyers, the Poor Laws, and the ills of debtors' prisons. As G. K. Chesterton noted, ""Before ÝDickens ̈ wrote a single real story, he had a kind of vision . . . a map full of fantastic towns, thundering coaches, clamorous market-places, uproarious inns, strange and swaggering figures. That vision was Pickwick.""",4,N/A,en
The Poetics of Manhood,['Michael Herzfeld'],1985,['History'],"""The Cretan mountain-dwellers are in particular famous for their sustained resistance to Turkish rule and then to German occupation. Their values, well-expressed in the motto of the Cretan writer Kazantzakis--'I hope for nothing; I fear nothing; I am free'--made them heroes at times when such qualities were positively endorsed in a Greece fighting to escape foreign domination. Today inevitably they are frowned on; Cretan shepherds are now caricatured as 'goat thieves and knife pullers', a survival of primitivism outrageous in a modern state. Herzfeld's excellent and sensitive ethnography of the pseudonymous village and inhabitants of Glendi, a mountain village in central Crete, is concerned with just these attributes, the ways they are lived and reproduced among Glendiots.""--Olivia Harris, Times Higher Education Supplement.--",N/A,N/A,en

Wired for Intimacy,['William M. Struthers'],2010-02,['Health & Fitness'],"Pornography is powerful. Our contemporary culture as been pornified, and it shapes our assumptions about identity, sexuality, the value of women and the nature of relationships. Countless Christian men struggle with the addictive power of porn. But common spiritual approaches of more prayer and accountability groups are often of limited help. In this book neuroscientist and researcher William Struthers explains how pornography affects the male brain and what we can do about it. Because we are embodied beings, viewing pornography changes how the brain works, how we form memories and make attachments. By better understanding the biological realities of our sexual development, we can cultivate healthier sexual perspectives and interpersonal relationships. Struthers exposes false assumptions and casts a vision for a redeemed masculinity, showing how our sexual longings can actually propel us toward sanctification and holiness in our bodies. With insights for both married and single men alike, this book offers hope for freedom from pornography.",N/A,N/A,en

The Pickwick Papers,['Charles Dickens'],1986,['Fiction'],"Written for publication as a serial, The Pickwick Papers is a sequence of loosely-related adventures. The action is given as occurring 1827-8, though critics have noted some seeming anachronisms. It has been stated that Dickens satirized the case of George Norton suing Lord Melbourne in The Pickwick Papers. The novel's main character, Samuel Pickwick, Esquire, is a kind and wealthy old gentleman, the founder and perpetual president of the Pickwick Club. To extend his researches into the quaint and curious phenomena of life, he suggests that he and three other ""Pickwickians"" (Mr Nathaniel Winkle, Mr Augustus Snodgrass, and Mr Tracy Tupman) should make journeys to places remote from London and report on their findings to the other members of the club. Their travels throughout the English countryside by coach provide the chief theme of the novel. A distinctive and valuable feature of the work is the generally accurate description of the old coaching inns of England. (One of the main families running the Bristol to Bath coaches at the time was started by Eleazer Pickwick).Its main literary value and appeal is formed by its numerous memorable characters. Each character in The Pickwick Papers, as in many other Dickens novels, is drawn comically, often with exaggerated personality traits. Alfred Jingle, who joins the cast in chapter two, provides an aura of comic villainy, with his devious tricks repeatedly landing the Pickwickians into trouble. These include a nearly successful attempted elopement with the spinster Rachael Wardle of Dingley Dell manor, misadventures with Dr Slammer, and others.",N/A,N/A,en
Mantissa,['John Fowles'],1982,['Fiction'],"Consciousness is arguably the most important area within contemporary philosophy ofmind and perhaps the most puzzling aspect of the world. Despite an explosion of research fromphilosophers, psychologists, and scientists, attempts to explain consciousness inneurophysiological, or even cognitive, terms are often met with great resistance. In TheConsciousness Paradox, Rocco Gennaro aims to solve an underlying paradox, namely, how itis possible to hold a number of seemingly inconsistent views, including higher-order thought (HOT)theory, conceptualism, infant and animal consciousness, concept acquisition, and what he calls theHOT-brain thesis. He defends and further develops a metapsychological reductive representationaltheory of consciousness and applies it to several importantly related problems. Gennaro proposes aversion of the HOT theory of consciousness that he calls the ""wide intrinsicality view"" and showswhy it is superior to various alternatives, such as self-representationalism and first-orderrepresentationalism. HOT theory says that what makes a mental state conscious is that a suitablehigher-order thought is directed at that mental state. Thus Gennaro argues for an overallphilosophical theory of consciousness while applying it to other significant issues not usuallyaddressed in the philosophical literature on consciousness. Most cognitive science and empiricalworks on such topics as concepts and animal consciousness do not address central philosophicaltheories of consciousness. Gennaro's integration of empirical and philosophical concerns will makehis argument of interest to both philosophers and nonphilosophers.",N/A,N/A,en

In The Will to Change, bell hooks gets to the heart of the matter and shows men how to express the emotions that are a fundamental part of who they are -- whatever their age, marital status, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. With trademark candor and fierce intelligence, hooks addresses the most common concerns of men, such as fear of intimacy and loss of their patriarchal place in society, in new and challenging ways. She believes men can find the way to spiritual unity by getting back in touch with the emotionally open part of themselves -- and lay claim to the rich and rewarding inner lives that have historically been the exclusive province of women.

Handbook of Studies on Men and Masculinities,"['Michael S. Kimmel', 'Jeff Hearn', 'Raewyn Connell']",2005,['Social Science'],"In the past, research in the field of gender has mainly addressed issues about women, and has for the most part been developed by women. Recently, the study of gender has rapidly expanded and there has been a growing interest in men′s and boys′ identities, conduct, and problems. The Handbook of Studies on Men and Masculinities is an interdisciplinary and international culmination of the growth of men′s studies that also offers insight about future directions for the field. The Handbook provides a broad view of masculinities primarily across the social sciences, with the inclusion of important debates in some areas of the humanities and natural sciences. The various approaches presented in this Handbook range across different disciplines, theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and conceptualizations in relation to the topic of men. Editors Michael S. Kimmel, Jeff Hearn, and Robert W. Connell have assembled an esteemed group of contributors who are among the best-known experts in their particular fields. The Handbook of Studies on Men and Masculinities examines the construction of masculinities in four different frames: the social organization of masculinities in their global and regional iterations; the institutional reproduction and articulation of masculinities; the ways in which masculinities are organized and practiced within a context of gender relations; and the ways in which individual men express and understand their gendered identities. The Handbook is organized in a way that moves from the larger, global, and institutional articulations of masculinities, to the more intimate and personal expressions. The Handbook of Studies on Men and Masculinities provides scholars, researchers, and students with the most current, incisive scholarship available for the men′s studies area of gender studies. It is a vital resource for those interested in the practical or cultural issues about men, boys, and gender, as well as an excellent addition to any academic library.",4.5,N/A,en

A New Name,['Jon Fosse'],2021-09-08,[],"Asle is an ageing painter and widower who lives alone on the southwest coast of Norway. His only friends are his neighbour, Åsleik, a traditional fisherman-farmer, and Beyer, a gallerist who lives in the city. There, in Bjørgvin, lives another Asle, also a painter but lonely and consumed by alcohol. Asle and Asle are doppelgängers - two versions of the same person, two versions of the same life, both grappling with existential questions. In this final instalment of Jon Fosse's Septology, the major prose work by 'the Beckett of the twenty-first century' (Le Monde), Christmas is approaching. Tradition has it that Åsleik and Asle eat lutefisk together, but this year Asle has agreed for the first time to celebrate Christmas with Åsleik and his sister, Guro. On Christmas Eve, Åsleik, Asle, and the dog Bragi take Åsleik's boat out on the Sygnefjord. Meanwhile, we follow the lives of the two Asles as younger adults in flashbacks: the narrator meets his lifelong love, Ales; joins the Catholic Church; starts exhibiting with Beyer; and can make a living by trying to paint away all the pictures stuck in his mind. After a while, Asle and Ales leave the city and move to the house in Dylgja. The other Asle gets married too, but his wedding ends with a sobbing bride and is followed soon after by a painful breakup. Written in melodious and hypnotic 'slow prose', A New Name: Septology VI-VII is a transcendent exploration of the human condition by Jon Fosse, and a radically other reading experience - incantatory, hypnotic, and utterly unique.",N/A,N/A,en

This narrowly misses his list of all-time top five most memorable split-ups. Rob seeks refuge in the company of Barry and Dick, the offbeat clerks at his store. They speak the masculine language of lists, endlessly reviewing their top five films (Reservoir Dogs...); top five Elvis Costello songs (""Alison""...); top five episodes of cheers (the one where Woody sang his stupid song to Kelly...). Rob tries dating a singer called Marie (a post-Partridge family, pre-L.A. Law Susan Dey), who once sold a song to Nanci Griffith. Her rendition of ""Baby, I Love Your Way"" makes him cry. But maybe it's just that he's always wanted to sleep with someone who has a record contract. Then he sees Laura again.

Our Dark Side,['Elisabeth Roudinesco'],2009-11-02,['History'],"Where does perversion begin? Who is perverse? Ever since the word first appeared in the Middle Ages, anyone who delights in evil and in the destruction of the self or others has been described as 'perverse'. But while the experience of perversion is universal, every era has seen it and dealt with it in its own way. The history of perversion in the West is told here through a study of great emblematic figures of the perverse - Gilles de Rais, the mystical saints and the flagellants in the middle ages, the Marquis de Sade in the eighteenth century, the masturbating child, the male homosexual and the hysterical woman nineteenth century, Nazism in the twentieth century, and the complementary figures of the paedophile and the terrorist in the twenty-first. The perverse are rarely talked about and when they are it is usually only to be condemned. They are commonly viewed as monstrous and cruel, as something alien to the very nature of being human. And yet, perversion can also attest to creativity and self-transcendence, to the refusal of individuals to submit to the rules and prohibitions that govern human life. Perversion fascinates us precisely because it can be both abject and sublime. Whether they are sublime because they turn to art or mysticism, or abject because they surrender to their murderous impulses, the perverse are part of us because they exhibit something that we always conceal: our own negativity and our dark side.",5,N/A,en

Anthem,['Ayn Rand'],2018-04-15,[],"Anthem is a dystopian fiction novella by Ayn Rand, first published in 1938. It takes place at some unspecified future date when mankind has entered another dark age as a result of the evils of irrationality and collectivism and the weaknesses of socialistic thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully planned (when it is allowed to occur at all) and the concept of individuality has been eliminated (for example, the word ""I"" has disappeared from the language). As is common in her work, Rand draws a clear distinction between the ""socialist/communal"" values of equality and brotherhood and the ""productive/capitalist"" values of achievement and individuality. Many of the novella's core themes, such as the struggle between individualism and collectivism, are echoed in Rand's later books, such as The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. However, the style of ""Anthem"" is unique among Rand's work, more narrative-centered and economical, lacking the intense didactic expressions of philosophical abstraction that occur in later works. It is probably her most accessible work.",N/A,N/A,en

The Myth of Sex Addiction,['David J. Ley'],2014-07-10,['Family & Relationships'],"The media today is filled with powerful men in trouble for their sexual behaviors, and invariably, they are diagnosed as sexual addicts. Since Adam first hid his nakedness from God and pointed the finger at Eve, men have struggled to take responsibility for their sexuality. Over the past three decades, these behaviors have come to reflect not a moral failing, but instead, evidence of an ill-defined disease, that of “sexual addiction.” The concept of sexual addiction is a controversial one because it is based on questionable research and subjective moral judgments. Labeling these behaviors as sex addiction asserts a false, dangerous myth that undermines personal responsibility. Not only does this epidemic of sex addiction excuses mislabel male sexuality as dangerous and unhealthy, but it destroys our ability to hold people accountable for their behaviors. By labeling males as weak and powerless before the onslaught and churning tide of lust, we take away those things that men should live up to: personal responsibility; integrity; self-control; independence; accountability; self-motivation; honor; respect for self and others. In The Myth of Sex Addiction, Ley presents the history and questionable science underlying this alleged disorder, exposing the moral and cultural judgments that are embedded in the concept, as well as the significant economic factors that drive the label of sex addiction in clinical practice and the popular media. Ley outlines how this label represents a social attack on many forms of sexuality—male sexuality in particular—as well as presenting the difficulty this label creates in holding people responsible for their sexual behaviors. Going against current assumptions and trends, Ley debunks the idea that sex addiction is real, or at least that it is as widespread as it appears to be. Instead, he suggests that the high-sex behaviors of some men is something that has been tacitly condoned for countless years and is only now labeled as a disorder as men are being held accountable to the same rules that have been applied to women. He suggests we should expect men to take responsibility for sexual choices, rather than supporting an approach that labels male sexual desire as a ""demonic force"" that must be resisted, feared, treated, and exorcised.",1,N/A,en
