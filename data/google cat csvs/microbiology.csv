Control of Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses during Infectious Diseases,['Julio Aliberti'],2011-09-21,['Medical'],"Upon infection the host needs to mount vigorous immune response against pathogen in order to successfully control its replication. However, once the infectious agent is controlled or eliminated, host cells need to signal the immune system to slow or cease its activities. While vast knowledge has been accumulated through the years on the mechanisms involved in the initiation and effector phases of the immune responses, the pathways triggered in order to modulate or end innate and acquired immunity are becoming more evident as evidence for its relevance comes to surface. Due to its biological power, evidence has surfaced indicating that eventually pathogens may take advantage of such regulatory pathways in order to escape effector mechanisms and progress to persistence. This book will discuss several cellular pathways involved in controlling immune response in the context of infectious diseases, their biological consequences and potential ""hijack"" of these pathways for the benefit of pathogen leading towards pathogen persistence as opposed to clearance.",N/A,N/A,en

Aspergillus and Aspergillosis,"['Hugo Van Den Bossche', 'Geert Cauwenbergh', 'Donald W. R. MacKenzie']",1988-04-01,['Medical'],"Species of aspergilli are common in man's environment and are responsible for a wide spectrum of human and animal disease, ranging in animals from mycotic abortion to aflatoxicosis and in humans from localized colonization of the ear or skin to life-threatening systemic infection of neutropenic patients. In recent times, invasive aspergillosis has become increasingly important as a cause of morbidity and death, initially in patients receiving immunosuppression prior to organ transplantation, and latterly in haematologic patients rendered neutropenic by underlying disease or chemotherapy. In some centres, the condition has been recorded in more than 40% of patients dying with acute leukaemia. Laboratory diagnostic procedures are not always helpful and the diagnosis depends largely on clinical parameters. The clinician is faced with yet another problem, that of management. At present, antifungal therapy of invasive aspergillosis can be largely ineffectual, and the mortality rate remains unacceptably high. Since Aspergillus fumigatus was first described almost 125 years ago, several other pathogenic species have been recognized. The marked biosynthetic abilities and varied mechanisms of gene recombination of aspergilli have long commanded attention in food technology and genetics. Their equally varied abilities to cause disease have attracted the interest of toxicologists, allergists and physicians concerned with infectious diseases.",N/A,N/A,en
Food Preservatives,"['Nicholas J. Russell', 'Grahame W. Gould']",2003-07-31,['Science'],"For centuries man has treated food to prolong its edible life, and nowadays both traditional and modern preservatives are used widely to ensure the satisfactory maintenance of quality and safety of foods. There continues to be increased public concern about the use of food additives, including preservatives, resulting from a perception that some of them may have deleterious effects on health. However, as eating habits have changed with an emphasis on what has been popularly termed a `healthy diet', there is at the same time a concern that reduction in preservative usage could lead to loss of safety and protection from food poisoning. While some preservatives are coming under increasing regulatory pressure others, particularly more natural ones, are receiving increased attention and gaining in importance and acceptability. This book supports the continued safe and effective use of preservatives within these current constraints. It therefore gives detailed information on the practical use of the major antimicrobial preservatives. Uniquely, it couples this with current understanding of their modes of action, at the levels of cellular physiology and biochemistry, in such a way as to provide a sound scientific basis for their efficacy. Such an approach also encourages the future logical development and use of preservatives.",3.5,N/A,en

The Food Safety Hazard Guidebook,"['Richard Lawley', 'Laurie Curtis', 'Judy Davis']",2012,['Science'],"Food safety is important and consumers have a right to expect that those who supply the food that they buy have taken every care to manufacture products that will do them no harm. Those with a responsibility for the regulation of the global food industry recognise this principle and legislate accordingly and the business of managing and regulating the safety of the food supply chain has come a long way in the last 25 years or so. Prompted by the emergence of new food safety hazards, such as the bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli O157, powerful new techniques for evaluating and managing the risks presented by these threats have been developed. For example, hazard analysis critical control point, or HACCP, has now become the food safety management system of choice worldwide. Although the food safety management tools are now widely available, they are still virtually useless unless they are supported by adequate and accurate information. HACCP does not work unless its practitioners have access to enough data and scientific knowledge to enable them to understand hazards and how to control them effectively. The Food Safety Hazard Guidebook is an attempt to address the problem of accessing the available information by distilling the key facts about a wide range of individual food safety hazards into a single text. The result is a guidebook, rather than an encyclopaedia, which acts as a portal for the immense and ever expanding body of scientific knowledge that exists for food safety. It is an easy-to-use information resource for anyone with a professional interest in the safety of the food supply. The book is easy to navigate and presents concise and carefully researched factual information on a wide range of biological and chemical hazards in a clear format that is designed to support risk analysis exercises and HACCP studies. It covers a broad range of established and emerging food safety hazards and includes details of authoritative sources of further information (many web-based) for those seeking to examine a topic in greater depth. The section on food allergens is a particularly valuable component of the book, the chapters on fish toxins are also useful and unusual in a book of this kind and bacterial pathogens are comprehensively covered. One of the most important features of the book is the wide scope of the content and the highly structured format designed to help the reader find information quickly. Other key benefits to the reader are: -The wide range of biological and chemical hazards covered in a single book -Written specifically with food industry professionals in mind -Easy to navigate and accessible for the non-expert -Clear and concise presentation of factual information presented in a format that lends itself to use in risk assessment exercises -Inclusion of references and web links to reliable sources of further information on each chapter -specifically designed for practical use by a professional readership.",N/A,N/A,en

Biodiversity and Earth History,"['Jens Boenigk', 'Sabina Wodniok', 'Edvard Glücksman']",2015-03-31,['Science'],"This uniquely interdisciplinary textbook explores the exciting and complex relationship between Earth’s geological history and the biodiversity of life. Its innovative design provides a seamless learning experience, clarifying major concepts step by step with detailed textual explanations complemented by detailed figures, diagrams and vibrant pictures. Thanks to its layout, the respective concepts can be studied individually, as part of the broader framework of each chapter, or as they relate to the book as a whole. It provides in-depth coverage of: - Earth’s formation and subsequent geological history, including patterns of climate change and atmospheric evolution; - The early stages of life, from microbial ‘primordial soup’ theories to the fossil record’s most valuable contributions; - Mechanisms of mutual influence between living organisms and the environment: how life changed Earth’s history whilst, at the same time, environmental pressures continue to shape the evolution of species; - Basic ideas in biodiversity studies: species concepts, measurement techniques, and global distribution patterns; - Biological systematics, from their historical origins in Greek philosophy and Biblical stories to Darwinian evolution by natural selection, and to phylogenetics based on cutting-edge molecular techniques. This book’s four major sections offer a fresh cross-disciplinary overview of biodiversity and the Earth’s history. Among many other concepts, they reveal the massive diversity of eukaryotes, explain the geological processes behind fossilisation, and provide an eye-opening account of the relatively short period of human evolution in the context of Earth’s 4.6 billion-year history. Employing a combination of proven didactic tools, the book is simultaneously a reading reference, illustrated guide, and encyclopaedia of organismal biology and geology. It is aimed at school- and university-level students, as well as members of the public fascinated by the intricate interrelationship of living organisms and their environment.",2.5,N/A,en

Biostatistics and Microbiology: A Survival Manual,['Daryl S. Paulson'],2008-11-23,['Science'],"influence on the conclusions that result. A very “conservative” statistic requires very strong proof to demonstrate significant differences, whereas a “liberal” one requires less. “Yuck,” you say already, “I just want to know the answer. ” To this, I respond, when in doubt, use a conventional statistical method, one that can be agreed on and accepted by most authorities. These conventional kinds of methods will be presented in this book. As you gain experience, choosing statistical methods will become almost an intuitive process. For example, for problems in which you have little experience, you will be very cautious and conservative. By analogy, this is similar to rafting a river for the first time. If you see rapids in the river, you will be more conservative as you approach them – wearing a life jacket and helmet, and using your paddle to avoid rocks – at least until you have expe- enced them and developed confidence. You will tend to be more liberal when near a sandy shore in clear, calm, shallow water. For experiments in microbiology in which you have much experience, your microbiological knowledge enables you to be more statistically liberal, as you will know whether the result of statistical analysis is microbiologically rational. Finally, statistics is not an end-all to finding answers. It is an aid in research, quality control, or diagnostic processes to support critical thinking and decisi- making.",N/A,N/A,en
"Adaptation to Life at High Salt Concentrations in Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya","['Nina Gunde-Cimerman', 'Aharon Oren', 'Ana Plemenitaš']",2005-12-28,['Science'],"Salt is an essential requirement of life. Already from ancient times (e. g. , see the books of the Bible) its importance in human life has been known. For example, salt symbolizes destruction (as in Sodom and Gomorra), but on the other hand it has been an ingredient of every sacrifice during the Holy Temple periods. Microbial life in concentrated salt solutions has fascinated scientists since its discovery. Recently there have been several international meetings and books devoted entirely to halophiles. This book includes the proceedings of the “Halophiles 2004” conference held in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in September 2004 (www. u- lj. si/~bfbhaloph/index. html). This meeting was attended by 120 participants from 25 countries. The editors have selected presentations given at the meeting for this volume, and have also invited a number of contributions from experts who had not been present in Ljubljana. This book complements “Halophilic Microorganisms”, edited by A. Ventosa and published by Springer-Verlag (2004), “Halophilic Microorganism and their Environments” by A. Oren (2002), published by Kluwer Academic Publishers as volume 5 of “Cellular Origins, Life in Extreme Habitats and Astrobiology” (COLE), and “Microbiology and Biogeochemistry of Hypersaline Environments” edited by A. Oren, and published by CRC Press, Boca Raton (1999).

Antimicrobial Resistance and Implications for the 21st Century,"['I.W. Fong', 'Karl Drlica']",2007-11-15,['Medical'],"Antimicrobial resistance can develop in any type of microbe (germ). Microbes can develop resistance to specific medicines. A common misconception is that a person’s body becomes resistant to specific drugs. However, it is microbes, not people that become resistant to the drugs. Drug resistance happens when microbes develop ways to survive the use of medicines meant to kill or weaken them. If a microbe is resistant to many drugs, treating the infections it causes can become difficult or even impossible. Someone with an infection that is resistant to a certain medicine can pass that resistant infection to another person. In this way, a hard-to-treat illness can be spread from person to person. In some cases, the illness can lead to serious disability or even death. This comprehensive, up-to-date volume aims to define issues and potential solutions to the challenges of antimicrobial resistance. The chapter authors are leading international experts on antimicrobial resistance among a variety of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, enteroccoci, staphylococci, gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria species) viruses (HIV, herpesviruses), and fungi (Candida species, fusarium etc.). The chapters will explore the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, the immunology and epidemiology of resistance strains, clinical implications and implications on research and lack thereof, and prevention and future directions. This volume will also describe the steps that researchers are taking to develop molecular methods for detecting resistance; develop drugs and other means to deal with newly-resistant organisms. A special chapter to address the issues on strategies to limit antimicrobial resistance propagation will be included in this volume.",4,N/A,en
The Deep Hot Biosphere,['Thomas Gold'],2013-12-01,['Science'],"This book sets forth a set of truly controversial and astonishing theories: First, it proposes that below the surface of the earth is a biosphere of greater mass and volume than the biosphere the total sum of living things on our planet's continents and in its oceans. Second, it proposes that the inhabitants of this subterranean biosphere are not plants or animals as we know them, but heat-loving bacteria that survive on a diet consisting solely of hydrocarbons that is, natural gas and petroleum. And third and perhaps most heretically, the book advances the stunning idea that most hydrocarbons on Earth are not the byproduct of biological debris (""fossil fuels""), but were a common constituent of the materials from which the earth itself was formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The implications are astounding. The theory proposes answers to often-asked questions: Is the deep hot biosphere where life originated, and do Mars and other seemingly barren planets contain deep biospheres? Evenmore provocatively, is it possible that there is an enormous store of hydrocarbons upwelling from deep within the earth that can provide us with abundant supplies of gas and petroleum? However far-fetched these ideas seem, they are supported by a growing body of evidence, and by the indisputable stature and seriousness Gold brings to any scientific debate. In this book we see a brilliant and boldly original thinker, increasingly a rarity in modern science, as he develops potentially revolutionary ideas about how our world works.",N/A,N/A,en

Vaccines: A Biography,['Andrew W. Artenstein'],2009-12-11,['Science'],"Why another book about vaccines? There are already a few extremely well-written medical textbooks that provide comprehensive, state-of-the-art technical reviews regarding vaccine science. Additionally, in the past decade alone, a number of engrossing, provocative books have been published on various related issues ra- ing from vaccines against specific diseases to vaccine safety and policy. Yet there remains a significant gap in the literature – the history of vaccines. Vaccines: A Biography seeks to fill a void in the extant literature by focusing on the history of vaccines and in so doing, recounts the social, cultural, and scientific history of vaccines; it places them within their natural, historical context. The book traces the lineage – the “biography” – of individual vaccines, originating with deeply rooted medical problems and evolving to an eventual conclusion. Nonetheless, these are not “biographies” in the traditional sense; they do not trace an individual’s growth and development. Instead, they follow an idea as it is conceived and dev- oped, through the contributions of many. These are epic stories of discovery, of risk-takers, of individuals advancing medical science, in the words of the famous physical scientist Isaac Newton, “by standing on the shoulders of giants. ” One grant reviewer described the book’s concept as “triumphalist”; although meant as an indictment, this is only partially inaccurate.",N/A,N/A,en

Ahmad'],2017-11-08,['Medical'],"This book is about the roles and importance of Ultraviolet (UV) light from sun and from man-made UV lamps in our daily life, on health and diseases, also its application in sterilization and treatment. The key words are: reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, UV mutagenicity, skin cancers, polymorphous light eruption, Xeroderma pigmentosum, vitiligo, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndromes, cardiovascular diseases, dermatology, photobiology, photodermatosis, vitamin D synthesis, vitamin D efficiency, water sterilization, blood sterilization, phototherapies, skin tanning and UV dosimeter. The book starts with introduction to UV light and the history of development of UV lamps and its applications. It then moves to describing the interaction of this light with biological components and the production of reactive oxygen species, their roles in cell signaling, cellular defense from foreign invaders, in mutagenesis leading to skin diseases including vitiligo, polymorphous light eruption and various forms of skin cancer. Then it presents the synthesis and importance of UV light and diseases, induced due to the deficiency of vitamin D. Roles of UV light in sterilization, disinfection, phototherapies are depicted in the next part and finally use and abuse of UV light in tanning salon and the availability and importance of use of UV dosimeter are highlighted. The three main focuses of this book are: - Damage to biological systems by UV light leading to certain skin diseases; most importantly skin cancers. - Importance of UV light in the in vivo synthesis of vitamin D when human bodies are exposed to it. - Diseases caused due to the deficiency of vitamin D and the use of UV lamps in phototherapy and sterilization processes.

Biotransformations in Organic Chemistry,['Kurt Faber'],2012-12-06,['Science'],"The use of natural catalysts -enzymes -for the transformation of non-natural man-made organic compounds is not at all new: they have been used for more than one hundred years, employed either as whole cells, cell organelles or isolated enzymes [1, 2]. Certainly, the object of most of the early research was totally different from that of the present day. Thus the elucidation of biochemical pathways and enzyme mechanisms was the main reason for research some decades ago. It was mainly during the 1980s that the enormous potential of applying natural catalysts to transform non-natural organic compounds was recognized. What started as a trend in the late 1970s could almost be called a fashion in synthetic organic chemistry in the 1990s. Although the early euphoria during the 'gold rush' in this field seems to have eased somewhat, there is still no limit to be seen for the future development of such methods. As a result of this extensive, recent research, there have been an estimated 12000 papers published on the subject. To collate these data as a kind of 'super-review' would clearly be an impossible task and, furthermore, such a hypothetical book would be unpalatable for the non-expert [3-6].",N/A,N/A,en

Fungi and Food Spoilage,"['John I. Pitt', 'Ailsa D. Hocking']",2022-09-02,['Technology & Engineering'],"The first three editions of Fungi and Food Spoilage established, then consolidated, a reputation as the leading book on foodborne fungi. It details media and methods for isolation and identification, descriptions of species, and information on their physiology, ecology and mycotoxin formation. It is an invaluable reference for food microbiologists investigating fungal food spoilage problems, both in field crops and processed foods, and the likelihood of mycotoxin production in either. The Fourth Edition incorporates major differences from the Third: multiple changes in nomenclature due to changes in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants; many taxonomic changes due to improvements in, and more widespread application of, molecular methods in taxonomy; the introduction of colour colony photographs where appropriate; and a new chapter on mycotoxins. The introductory chapters of the book deal with the ecology of food spoilage, and provide an overview of how food processing, packaging and storage parameters influence fungal growth. A subsequent chapter overviews the fundamentals of naming and classifying fungi. Morphological methods and media suitable for low cost and effective isolation, enumeration and identification of foodborne fungi are provided, together with many more specialised media and techniques. The major part of the book provides keys, descriptions and illustrations of all yeasts and filamentous fungi commonly encountered in foods. Other known characteristics of the species, including physiology and ecology are included. Chapters on the types and species of fungi likely to be found in fresh, harvested and variously processed foods are followed by a new chapter on mycotoxins, both major and minor, their sources, both fungal and food, and their implications for human health. The broad and practical nature of the coverage will appeal to microbiologists, mycologists and biotechnologists in the food industry, as well scientists in academic, research and public health institutions.

E. coli in Motion,['Howard C. Berg'],2004,['Medical'],"The bacterium Escherichia coli – E. coli for short – has long been the organism of choice for unraveling biochemical pathways, deciphering the genetic code, learning how DNA is replicated and read, and even for manufacturing proteins of commercial interest. For some thirty years, it also has been a model for studying the molecular biology of behavior. E. coli swims in a purposeful manner, propelled by long thin helical filaments, each driven at its base by a reversible rotary engine. As a microscopic organism immersed in an aqueous environment, it has mastered physical constraints utterly different from any that we know, devising sensors, comparators, and motors on the nanometer scale. This cross-disciplinary monograph describes these feats in a manner accessible to scientists, engineers, and others not trained in microbiology who would like to learn more about living machines. It treats the history of the subject, the physiology, physics, biochemistry and genetics, largely from first principles. It is all about a small but remarkably sophisticated friend who lives in your gut. Topics discussed include: How does E. coli move about? How do cells decide whether life is getting better or worse? What is the machinery that makes this behavior possible? How is the construction of this machinery programmed? How does this machinery work? What remains to be discovered?",5,N/A,en

Biocommunication of Fungi,['Günther Witzany'],2012-05-31,['Science'],"Fungi are sessile, highly sensitive organisms that actively compete for environmental resources both above and below the ground. They assess their surroundings, estimate how much energy they need for particular goals, and then realise the optimum variant. They take measures to control certain environmental resources. They perceive themselves and can distinguish between ‘self’ and ‘non-self’. They process and evaluate information and then modify their behaviour accordingly. These highly diverse competences show us that this is possible owing to sign(aling)-mediated communication processes within fungal cells (intraorganismic), between the same, related and different fungal species (interorganismic), and between fungi and non-fungal organisms (transorganismic). Intraorganismic communication involves sign-mediated interactions within cells (intracellular) and between cells (intercellular). This is crucial in coordinating growth and development, shape and dynamics. Such communication mustfunction both on the local level and between widely separated mycelium parts. This allows fungi to coordinate appropriate response behaviors in a differentiated manner to their current developmental status and physiological influences.",N/A,N/A,en

Microbial Biochemistry,['G.N. Cohen'],2011-02-02,['Science'],"Microbial physiology, biochemistry, and genetics allowed the formulation of concepts that turned out to be important in the study of higher organisms. In the first section, the principles of bacterial growth are given, as well as the description of the different layers that enclose the bacterial cytoplasm, and their role in obtaining nutrients from the outside media through different permeability mechanism described in detail. A chapter is devoted to allostery and is indispensable for the comprehension of many regulatory mechanisms described throughout the book. Another section analyses the mechanisms by which cells obtain the energy necessary for their growth, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic and the anaplerotic cycles. Two chapters are devoted to classes of microorganisms rarely dealt with in textbooks, namely the Archaea, mainly the methanogenic bacteria, and the methylotrophs. Eight chapters describe the principles of the regulations at the transcriptional level, with the necessary knowledge of the machineries of transcription and translation. The next fifteen chapters deal with the biosynthesis of the cell building blocks, amino acids, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and deoxynucleotides, water-soluble vitamins and coenzymes, isoprene and tetrapyrrole derivatives and vitamin B12. The two last chapters are devoted to the study of protein-DNA interactions and to the evolution of biosynthetic pathways. The considerable advances made in the last thirty years in the field by the introduction of gene cloning and sequencing and by the exponential development of physical methods such as X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance have helped presenting metabolism under a multidisciplinary attractive angle. The level of readership presupposes some knowledge of chemistry and genetics at the undergraduate level. The target group is graduate students, researchers in academia and industry.",N/A,N/A,en

Basic and Applied Aspects of Biopesticides,['K. Sahayaraj'],2014-07-10,['Technology & Engineering'],"Currently, the major challenge of humanity is focused on population growth through agricultural production in order to meet the demand for food. The food crunch is mainly due to pest and disease. Traditional methods, synthetic insecticides and microbicides cause health hazards to human beings, domestic animals and also affect our immediate environments. Serious concerns were implemented by both developing and developed countries as Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Bio-intensive Integrated Pest Management (BIPM) systems where biopesticides play an important role worldwide. The available books are limited to particular aspects of biopesticides. Hence, it is imperative to bring out a holistic documentation which will provide the reader information on all aspects of biopesticides. The book consists of five sections namely microbials, botanicals, natural enemies semio- chemicals and biotechnology and equipments, bioinformatics tools and IPM. In Section I, microbial deals with utilization of Bacillus in control of phytonematodes; biological control of pest and diseases with fluorescent pseudomonads, entomopathogenic fungus and entomopathogenic nematodes in pest management, microbial viral insecticides and microbial elicitors to induce immunity for plant disease control in chilli and tomato. Importance of plant essential oils, botanicals in endocrine disruption, relevance of botanicals and use of plant volatile on pest management has been discussed in Section II. Importance and role of reduviidae, weaver ants, ground beetles, Odonatas, spiders in biological control has been discussed in Section III. In addition, genetic improvement of biocontrol agents for sustainable pest management has also been highlighted. In Section IV, classical practices and pheromone, kairomonal enhancement to natural enemies and use of transgenic plants in insect control are highlighted. Equipment and their application methodologies for application of biopesticides; relevance of bioinformatics in biopesticides management; pest management of soybean, bio fouling and eco friendly antifoulants have been highlighted in Section V.

The Machinery of Life,['David S. Goodsell'],2009-04-10,['Science'],"Imagine that we had some way to look directly at the molecules in a living organism. An x-ray microscope would do the trick, or since we’re dreaming, perhaps an Asimov-style nanosubmarine (unfortunately, neither is currently feasible). Think of the wonders we could witness firsthand: antibodies atta- ing a virus, electrical signals racing down nerve fibers, proteins building new strands of DNA. Many of the questions puzzling the current cadre of sci- tists would be answered at a glance. But the nanoscale world of molecules is separated from our everyday world of experience by a daunting million-fold difference in size, so the world of molecules is completely invisible. I created the illustrations in this book to help bridge this gulf and allow us to see the molecular structure of cells, if not directly, then in an artistic rendition. I have included two types of illustrations with this goal in mind: watercolor paintings which magnify a small portion of a living cell by one million times, showing the arrangement of molecules inside, and comput- generated pictures, which show the atomic details of individual molecules. In this second edition of The Machinery of Life, these illustrations are presented in full color, and they incorporate many of the exciting scientific advances of the 15 years since the first edition.",4.5,N/A,en

Life at small scale,['David B. Dusenbery'],1996,['Microbiology'],"In Life at Small Scale, noted biophysicist David B. Dusenbery describes how microbes obtain and use information from their environments to meet the fundamental challenges all organisms face - getting food, avoiding predators and competitors, and dispersing progeny. As Dusenbery demonstrates, these organisms are hardly as simple as is often presumed. Despite their size (or rather because of it), microbes develop some surprisingly complex behaviors, all in response to the physical demands of the worlds they inhabit. Thus the pages of this captivating, richly illustrated volume are filled with descriptions of organisms that have devised remarkably sophisticated, often bizarre ways of moving, navigating, communicating, eating, resisting enemies, besting rivals, and reproducing. From fungi that launch their spores as projectiles, to ""magnetic"" bacteria that align like compass needles with the Earth's magnetic field, to the microbes that disperse when we sneeze, Life at Small Scale introduces an intriguing cast of characters, exploring their lives and environments in exquisite detail. It also shows how knowledge gained from the study of microbes helps us understand life on human and global scales as well.

Developmental Biology of Flowering Plants,['V. Raghavan'],2012-12-06,['Science'],"The study of the development of flowering plants may be said to be in the throes of a revolution. The literature on the subject is extensive and continues to grow rapidly as new discoveries pile one on top of the other; moreover, these striking advances in our knowledge have put plant developmental biology well ahead of other aspects of the study of plants. This has come about after a period of neglect and stagnation in the field and has been triggered by the power of recombinant DNA technology to analyze genetic information and by a fruitful cross-fertilization between physiology, genetics, and molecular biology. Whereas considerations of developmental phenomena were at one time largely restricted to the structure and physiology of a wide selection of plants, recent molecular and genetic approaches are focused on one or two model systems. Notwithstanding the difficulty of having to relate developmental mechanisms in a few experimentally attractive models to the enormous range of plants, the use of model systems has gained wide accep tance. This book is intended to meet the need for a unified account of the general principles of development of flowering plants representing structural, physiolog ical, biochemical, genetic, and molecular perspectives.

Deadly Companions,['Dorothy H. Crawford'],2009,['History'],"Ever since we started huddling together in communities, the story of human history has been inextricably entwined with the story of microbes. They have evolved and spread amongst us, shaping our culture through infection, disease, and pandemic. At the same time, our changing human culture has itself influenced the evolutionary path of microbes. Dorothy H. Crawford here shows that one cannot be truly understood without the other. Beginning with a dramatic account of the SARS pandemic at the start of the 21st century, she takes us back in time to follow the interlinked history of microbes and man, taking an up-to-date look at ancient plagues and epidemics, and identifying key changes in the way humans have lived - such as our move from hunter-gatherer to farmer to city-dweller - which made us vulnerable to microbe attack. Showing how we live our lives today - with increasing crowding and air travel - puts us once again at risk, Crawford asks whether we might ever conquer microbes completely, or whether we need to take a more microbe-centric view of the world. Among the possible answers, one thing becomes clear: that for generations to come, our deadly companions will continue to shape human history.",N/A,N/A,en

Modern Food Microbiology,['James M. Jay'],2012-12-06,['Technology & Engineering'],"This fifth edition of Modern Food Microbiology places special emphasis on foodborne microorganisms, as the previous four editions attempted to do. A good understanding of the basic biology offoodborne organisms is more critical for food scientists now than in previous decades. With so many microbiologists in the 1990s devoting their attention to genes and molecules, one objective of this text is to provide a work that places emphasis on entire microbial cells as well as their genes and molecules. For textbook usage, this edition is best suited for a second or subsequent course in microbiology. Although organic chemistry is a desirable prerequisite, those with a good grasp of general biology and chemistry should not find this book difficult. In addition to its use as a course text, this edition, like the previous, contains material that goes beyond what normally is covered in a one-term course. For use as a food microbiology text, suggested starting points are the sections in Chapter 2 that deal with the sources and types of microorganisms in foods followed by the principles outlined in Chapter 3. The food product chapters (Chaps. 4-9) may be covered to the extent that one wishes, but the principles from Chapters 2 and 3 should be stressed during this coverage. A somewhat logical next step would be food preservation methods as outlined in Chapters 13-17 where again the principles from Chapter 3 come into play.",N/A,N/A,en

Microbiology of Fermented Foods,['B.J. Wood'],2012-12-06,['Science'],"When I undertook the production of the First Edition of this book it was my first foray into the world of book editing, and I had no idea of what I was undertaking! I was not entirely alone in this, as in asking me to produce such a book the commissioning Editor, Mr George Olley of Elsevier Ap plied Science Publishers, had pictured a text of perhaps 300 pages, but on seeing my list of chapter titles realized that we were talking about a - chapter, two-volume work. We eventually decided to go ahead with it, and the result was more successful than either of us had dared to hope could be It was therefore with rather mixed emotions that I contemplated the case. a second edition at the suggestion of Blackie Press, who had taken over the title from Elsevier. On the one hand, I was naturally flattered that the book was considered important enough to justify a second edition. On the other hand, I was very well aware that the task would be even greater this time.",N/A,N/A,en

The Springer Index of Viruses,"['Christian Tidona', 'Gholamreza Darai']",2011-10-13,['Science'],"The continuous growth of knowledege makes it very difficult for scientists to retrieve comprehensive and accurate data on viruses. The desired information is often dispersed in a variety of books, journals and online resources. This encyclopedia presents the latest facts about all known viruses in a standardized form created by hundreds of the world's leading virologists. Virus taxonomy represents the basic framework that allows an understanding of the complex evolutionary process that continuously takes place among viruses and their hosts. Each of the 300 taxonomically ordered chapters includes detailed information on individual genus members, historical events, the hosts they can affect (animal, man or plant), virion morphology, genome properties, replication strategy, properties of individual transcripts and proteins, sequence accession numbers, biological properties, diseases, recombinant vector constructs, vaccine strains, key references, as well as a high-resolution particle image and a drawing of the genome organization. Its high content of easily accessible detailed information makes this Encyclopedia an indispensable tool for both researchers and lecturers. The new edition includes the recent discoveries made in this field as well as new viruses which have been discovered.",N/A,N/A,en
