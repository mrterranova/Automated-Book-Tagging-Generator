The Future of Money,['Benjamin J. Cohen'],2004,['Business & Economics'],"This book is a thoughtful, amply documented reflection on the future of currency. The dollar, euro and yen dominate the global monetary order, with the dollar now unrivaled at the top and unlikely to be threatened in the future. The countries that issue lesser currencies face a trade-off between monetary sovereignty and international acceptability (with all its economic advantages). Some economists say these lesser currencies should simply dollarize, that is, sacrifice their monetary sovereignty on the altar of international economic efficiency by adopting a stronger currency as their own. Author Benjamin J. Cohen argues that these countries are likely to reject dollarization because the emotional and political advantages of issuing one's own currency are simply too strong. He suggests various alternate mechanisms that allow countries to maintain some monetary independence and authority while gaining the advantages of a fully liquid, widely used currency. Non-specialists may find his extensive discussions a bit dry or sometimes tedious, but getAbstract.com applauds the author's ability to explore monetary economics in admirably lucid detail.",5,N/A,en

Marginal Gains,['Jane I. Guyer'],2004-03,['Business & Economics'],"In America, almost all the money in circulation passes through financial institutions every day. But in Nigeria's ""cash and carry"" system, 90 percent of the currency never comes back to a bank after it's issued. What happens when two such radically different economies meet and mingle, as they have for centuries in Atlantic Africa? The answer is a rich diversity of economic practices responsive to both local and global circumstances. In Marginal Gains, Jane I. Guyer explores and explains these often bewildering practices, including trade with coastal capitalism and across indigenous currency zones, and within the modern popular economy. Drawing on a wide range of evidence, Guyer demonstrates that the region shares a coherent, if loosely knit, commercial culture. She shows how that culture actually works in daily practice, addressing both its differing scales of value and the many settings in which it operates, from crisis conditions to ordinary household budgets. The result is a landmark study that reveals not just how popular economic systems work in Africa, but possibly elsewhere in the Third World.",N/A,N/A,en

Making Money,['Terry Pratchett'],2007-09-18,['Fiction'],"The Ankh-Morpork Post Office is running like . . . well, not at all like a government office. The mail is delivered promptly; meetings start and end on time; five out of six letters relegated to the Blind Letter Office ultimately wend their way to the correct addresses. Postmaster General Moist von Lipwig, former arch-swindler and confidence man, has exceeded all expectations—including his own. So it's somewhat disconcerting when Lord Vetinari summons Moist to the palace and asks, ""Tell me, Mr. Lipwig, would you like to make some real money?"" Vetinari isn't talking about wages, of course. He's referring, rather, to the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork, a venerable institution that haas run for centuries on the hereditary employment of the Men of the Sheds and their loyal outworkers, who do make money in their spare time. Unfortunately, it costs more than a penny to make a penny, so the whole process seems somewhat counterintuitive. Next door, at the Royal Bank, the Glooper, an ""analogy machine,"" has scientifically established that one never has quite as much money at the end of the week as one thinks one should, and the bank's chairman, one elderly Topsy (née Turvy) Lavish, keeps two loaded crossbows at her desk. Oh, and the chief clerk is probably a vampire. But before Moist has time to fully consider Vetinari's question, fate answers it for him. Now he's not only making money, but enemies too; he's got to spring a prisoner from jail, break into his own bank vault, stop the new manager from licking his face, and, above all, find out where all the gold has gone—otherwise, his life in banking, while very exciting, is going to be really, really short. . . .",N/A,N/A,en

Exorbitant Privilege,['Barry Eichengreen'],2011-01-07,['Business & Economics'],"For more than half a century, the U.S. dollar has been not just America's currency but the world's. It is used globally by importers, exporters, investors, governments and central banks alike. Nearly three-quarters of all $100 bills circulate outside the United States. The dollar holdings of the Chinese government alone come to more than $1,000 per Chinese resident.This dependence on dollars, by banks, corporations and governments around the world, is a source of strength for the United States. It is, as a critic of U.S. policies once put it, America's ""exorbitant privilege."" However, recent events have raised concerns that this soon may be a privilege lost. Among these have been the effects of the financial crisis and the Great Recession: high unemployment, record federal deficits, and financial distress. In addition there is the rise of challengers like the euro and China's renminbi. Some say that the dollar may soon cease to be the world's standard currency--which would depress American living standards and weaken the country's international influence.In Exorbitant Privilege, one of our foremost economists, Barry Eichengreen, traces the rise of the dollar to international prominence over the course of the 20th century. He shows how the greenback dominated internationally in the second half of the century for the same reasons--and in the same way--that the United States dominated the global economy. But now, with the rise of China, India, Brazil and other emerging economies, America no longer towers over the global economy. It follows, Eichengreen argues, that the dollar will not be as dominant. But this does not mean that the coming changes will necessarily be sudden and dire--or that the dollar is doomed to lose its international status. Challenging the presumption that there is room for only one true global currency--either the dollar or something else--Eichengreen shows that several currencies have shared this international role over long periods. What was true in the distant past will be true, once again, in the not-too-distant future.The dollar will lose its international currency status, Eichengreen warns, only if the United States repeats the mistakes that led to the financial crisis and only if it fails to put its fiscal and financial house in order. The greenback's fate hinges, in other words, not on the actions of the Chinese government but on economic policy decisions here in the United States.Incisive, challenging and iconoclastic, Exorbitant Privilege, which was shortlisted for the FT Goldman Sachs 2011 Best Business Book of the Year, is a fascinating analysis of the changes that lie ahead. It is a challenge, equally, to those who warn that the dollar is doomed and to those who regard its continuing dominance as inevitable.",N/A,N/A,en

Power and Money,['Ernest Mandel'],1992-06-17,['Business & Economics'],"Analyses of bureaucratic power and privilege have an academic pedigree but have also long preoccupied socialists. The collapse of communist rule in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe puts to a new test the classical theories concerning the relationship between bureaucracy and class. Power and Money is a timely contribution to this renewal of theory, exploring the social and historical roots of bureaucracy, both within the capitalist state and in workers’ mass organizations. Ernest Mandel draws on archival and contemporary accounts in an analysis of both capitalist administration and the ideology and practice of bureaucratic dictatorship in the communist bloc. He measures the actual performance of western and eastern societies against the forecasts of Lenin and Trotsky, Ludwig von Mises and Roberto Michels, or the more recent reflections of Amitai Etzioni and Alvin Gouldner. This lucid study challenges those theories—Stalinist, Weberian or social-democratic—which claim that an autonomous officialdom is a necessary feature of modern societies. It also furnishes a perceptive account of the specific dynamics of communist and post-communist society.",N/A,N/A,en

Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments? The shocking answer is: None of the above! In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life! Eker does this by identifying your money and success blueprint. We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money -- and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success. Using the principles he teaches, T. Harv Eker went from zero to millionaire in only two and a half years. Eker is president of Peak Potentials Training, one of the fastest growing success training companies in North America. With his unique brand of street smarts with heart, Eker's humorous, cut-to-the-chase style keeps his audience spellbound. People come from all over the world to attend his sold-out seminars, where crowds often exceed 2,000 people for a weekend program. So far, Eker's teachings have touched the lives of more than a quarter million people. Now, for the first time, he shares his proven secrets of success in this revolutionary book.

Understanding Modern Money Theory,['L. Randall Wray'],2025-05-16,['Business & Economics'],"In this illuminating book, Randall Wray explores the origins, nature, and evolution of money, emphasizing the critical role played by both credit and state money in capitalism. Integrating and updating the influential theories presented in Wray's previous books, Money and Credit in Capitalist Economies and Understanding Modern Money, this new book addresses key questions in modern economic theory and policy. Wray adopts the monetary theory of production shared by the three principle heterodox traditions, Marxism, Institutionalism and Keynesianism to highlight the role played by money in the capitalist system. He applies Keynes's liquidity preference theory and Marx's labor theory of value to examine the determinants of the value of money and uncover the systemic properties driving capitalist production. He provides insights into the vital role of the state in the development and regulation of the modern monetary system. Finally, he identifies how monetary and fiscal policy can be improved to mitigate future challenges and promote economic, social and environmental sustainability. Students and scholars of heterodox approaches to economic theory, the endogenous approach to money and banking, and fiscal and monetary policy will greatly benefit from this valuable book. It is also a vital resource for academics studying the social sciences, such as sociology, political science and anthropology.",N/A,N/A,en

A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested - which can happen if interest rates are too high - then unemployment will rise.

The Optimum Quantity of Money,"['Nicholas Eberstadt', 'Milton Friedman']",2017-09-20,[],"This classic set of essays by Nobel Laureate and leading monetary theorist Milton Friedman presents a coherent view of the role of money, focusing on specific topics related to the empirical analysis of monetary phenomena and policy. The early chapters cover factors determining the real quantity of money held in a community and the welfare implications of policies that affect the quantity held. The following chapters formally restate why quantity analysis has become central to the science of economics. Friedman's presidential address to the American Economic Association, included here, provides a general summary of his views on the role of monetary policy, with an emphasis on its limitations and its possibilities. This theoretical framework is used in examining a number of empirical problems: the demand for money, the explanation of price changes in wartime periods, and the role of money in business cycles. These essays summarize some of the most important results of Friedman's extensive research over the course of his lifetime. The chapters on policy that follow survey the positions of earlier economists and deal with the importance of lags and the implications of destabilizing speculation in foreign markets. Taken as a whole, The Optimum Quantity of Money provides a comprehensive view of the body of monetary theory developed in leading centers of monetary analysis.

"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money",['John Maynard Keynes'],2013-09-28,['Economics'],"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money The ""Keynesian Revolution"" Complete EditionBy John Maynard Keynes The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was written by the English economist John Maynard Keynes. The book, generally considered to be his magnum opus, is largely credited with creating the terminology and shape of modern macroeconomics. Published in February 1936, it sought to bring about a revolution, commonly referred to as the ""Keynesian Revolution"", in the way economists thought - especially in relation to the proposition that a market economy tends naturally to restore itself to full employment after temporary shocks. Regarded widely as the cornerstone of Keynesian thought, the book challenged the established classical economics and introduced important concepts such as the consumption function, the multiplier, the marginal efficiency of capital, the principle of effective demand and liquidity preference. The central argument of The General Theory is that the level of employment is determined, not by the price of labour as in neoclassical economics, but by the spending of money (aggregate demand). Keynes argues that it is wrong to assume that competitive markets will, in the long run, deliver full employment or that full employment is the natural, self-righting, equilibrium state of a monetary economy. On the contrary, under-employment and under-investment are likely to be the natural state unless active measures are taken. One implication of The General Theory is that a lack of competition is not the fundamental problem and measures to reduce unemployment by cutting wages or benefits are not only hard-hearted but ultimately futile.",N/A,N/A,en

His study also links Chinese monetary history to changing trends in money-use and trade in gold and silver in Asia, Europe, and the Western Hemisphere. He argues that China's shift to a silver economy had a decisive influence not only on the growth of a market economy in China but also on the formation of a global economy in the early modern era.

Coined,['Kabir Sehgal'],2015,['Money'],"Money isn't just coins, bank notes or clamshells; it is more than a store of value or unit of payment. It's an idea, a transformative player in how we view, cope, and harmonise with the world. Like it or not, money is a measure of status, well-being, and our chances to survive and thrive. Money isn't just what makes the world go around; it is largely what makes each of us go around. In Coined, Kabir Sehgal travels the world while presenting a multidimensional portrait of currency through the ages. He explores the origin of exchange in the Galapagos Islands, searches for hoards of coins from an ancient civilization in Bangladesh, and learns about the art that appears on money from coin collectors in Vietnam. He takes you from the vaults beneath the Federal Reserve in New York to a beehive where pollen can be understood as a natural form of exchange. He details the birth of money, to its place in our culture both past and present, to how the obsession for it can lead to death and destruction, all the while mixing engaging and entertaining stories from the front lines of global currency exchange with extensive, thoughtful research.The story of money is rich and varied because it is our story.",N/A,N/A,en

Yet despite the centrality of political struggles over money, it remains difficult to articulate its democratic possibilities and limits. 'The Currency of Politics' takes readers from ancient Greece to today to provide an intellectual history of money, drawing on the insights of key political philosophers to show how money is not just a medium of exchange but also a central institution of political rule. Money appears to be beyond the reach of democratic politics, but this appearance - like so much about money - is deceptive. Even when the politics of money is impossible to ignore, its proper democratic role can be difficult to discern.",N/A,N/A,en

Revealed inside are the secrets to acquiring money, keeping money, and making money earn more money. Providing financial wisdom through parables, 'The Richest Man in Babylon' was originally a set of pamphlets, written by the author and distributed by banks and insurance companies.

These were distributed in large quantities by banks and insurance companies and became familiar to millions, the most famous being 'The Richest Man in Babylon', the parable from which the present volume takes its title.

Follow the Money,['Ruben Alvarado'],2013-02,['Economic history'],"""A highly readable disentangling of currency's past and present"" -- Kirkus Reviews. Follow the Money is based on a startling insight: there are three different forms of money, not just one; and the form of money a society implements both determines and expresses the kind of society it will be, and what's more, how it will think. For money is not neutral. It is a product of human artifice, the particular expression of a particular society, that at the same time determines the further course of that society, not just in terms of economics, but in all areas of cultural endeavor. This thesis is implemented with verve. The book takes the reader on a journey through history, beginning with ancient Meso­potamia, through Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome, then through medieval and early-modern Europe in its interaction with the Near and Far East, all the way to the modern-day community of nations. It demonstrates in no uncertain terms just how decisive the institution of money has been, and at the same time just how misunderstood - its role, its effects, even the very form it takes. This is still the case, with the result that political choices and action end up entirely misguided. It is especially true of the attempt to address the credit and debt crises afflicting the world today. The way forward will only come through a better understanding of money as institution. This book is a first step in arriving at such an understanding. As such, it takes the form of historical inquiry, which is the only form such a first step can take. Kirkus Review: ""In this stimulating, offbeat work of history, the author posits that the manufacture and manipulation of money-and the radically different approaches societies have taken to both those activities-have shaped events in more comprehensive ways than standard histories allow. The author carefully examines ancient cultures, such as those of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Babylon and Phoenicia, and calls their central monetary device of precious metals the ""universal glue"" of these societies. The artificiality of metal standards, he points out, has been a bone of economic contention throughout history; for example, he quotes U.S. presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan's 1896 Democratic National Convention speech crying out against a gold standard, which he saw as potentially crucifying mankind upon ""a cross of gold."" The gold standard takes a beating from Alvarado as well, who asserts that ""the nations of the world have no need of a Wizard of Oz to grant them prosperity."" He writes of the gold mania that gripped Byzantium in the decades prior to its fall in 1453 and insists that ""gold became an albatross around the empire's neck; the single-minded pursuit of coined perfection contributed in great degree to the empire's demise."" He also rails against the ""triumph of prodigious proportions"" that allowed international bankers to seek control of currency, ""not of one nation, but of all nations at once."" Finally, Alvarado makes a wide-ranging case against the concept of fixed rates of exchange, claiming they ultimately strangle economic growth. The author's research is vast, and he marshals his facts with considerable skill. Readers with no financial background won't feel daunted by this history, but they may likely find it informative.""",N/A,N/A,en

Money, Banking and Inflationfocuses on such traditional central banking concerns as money stock control, price level stabilization, interest rates smoothing, exchange rate targeting, lender-of-last-resort responsibilities, limitations imposed by short-run trade-offs and non-neutralities, and appropriate responses to supply shocks. Three of the essays, however, digress from these themes to focus on geometrical diagrams employed in price theory and the theory of commercial policy. Virtually all the essays take an historical-doctrinal perspective which besides showing how these theories developed over time, allows them to be ranked according to their effectiveness in monetary controversies old and new.
