De natura deorum,['Ovid'],2000-11-02,['History'],"Book XIII of Ovid's Metamorphoses presents a wide variety of brilliant episodes, from the rhetorically charged contest between Ulysses and Ajax over the arms of Achilles, to the tragic tale of Hecuba and her gruesome revenge, to the amusing story of Polyphemus' unrequited love for Galatea and its bloody conclusion. This edition discusses in detail Ovid's treatment of his sources and sets out the ways in which he has adapted earlier literature as material for his novel work. Guidance is offered on points of language and style, and the Introduction treats in general terms the themes of metamorphosis and the structure of the poem as a whole.",N/A,N/A,en

The Cambridge Companion to Greek Tragedy,['P. E. Easterling'],1997-10-02,['Drama'],"As a creative medium, ancient Greek tragedy has had an extraordinarily wide influence: many of the surviving plays are still part of the theatrical repertoire, and texts like Agamemnon, Antigone, and Medea have had a profound effect on Western culture. This Companion is not a conventional introductory textbook but an attempt, by seven distinguished scholars, to present the familiar corpus in the context of modern reading, criticism, and performance of Greek tragedy. There are three main emphases: on tragedy as an institution in the civic life of ancient Athens, on a range of different critical interpretations arising from fresh readings of the texts, and on changing patterns of reception, adaptation, and performance from antiquity to the present. Each chapter can be read independently, but each is linked with the others, and most examples are drawn from the same selection of plays.",4,N/A,en

The Raw and the Cooked,['Claude Lévi-Strauss'],1983-03-15,['Religion'],"In anthropological terms the concept of ""the raw"" verses ""the cooked"" has long been associated with the dichotomy between the natural world and the world of human culture. In a broad-based empirical study of native mythologies, Claude Lévi-Strauss proposes a structural and thematic link between the opposition of the raw and the cooked in mythological thought and man's attempt to establish a balanced relationship between natural and cultural forces. Lévi-Strauss postulates that the raw/cooked axis is characteristic of all human culture, with elements falling along the ""raw"" side of the axis being those of ""natural"" origin, and those on the ""cooked"" side being of ""cultural"" origin - i.e. products of human creation. Symbolically, cooking marks the transition from nature to culture, by means of which the human state can be defined in accordance with all its attributes. In mythological thought, the cooking of food is, in effect, a form of mediation between nature and society, between life and death, and between heaven and earth. The cook, in turn, can be viewed as a cultural agent whose function is to ""mediate the conjunction of the raw product and the human consumer,"" the operation of which has the effect of ""making sure the natural is at once cooked and socialized.""",N/A,N/A,en

Lévi-Strauss critiques psychoanalytic interpretation and defends the interpretive powers of structuralism. ""Electrifying. . . . A brilliant demonstration of structural analysis in action. . . .

In punishment, Zeus chained him to a rock, where an eagle clawed unceasingly at his liver, until Herakles freed him. For the Greeks, the myth of Prometheus's release reflected a primordial law of existence and the fate of humankind. Carl Kerényi examines the story of Prometheus and the very process of mythmaking as a reflection of the archetypal function and seeks to discover how this primitive tale was invested with a universal fatality, first in the Greek imagination, and then in the Western tradition of Romantic poetry. Kerényi traces the evolving myth from Hesiod and Aeschylus, and in its epic treatment by Goethe and Shelley; he moves on to consider the myth from the perspective of Jungian psychology, as the archetype of human daring signifying the transformation of suffering into the mystery of the sacrifice.",N/A,N/A,en

Myth,['G. S. Kirk'],1973-06-08,['History'],"This book, developed out of the 1969 Sather lectures at Berkeley, California, confronts a wide range of problems concerning the nature, meaning and functions of myths. Professor Kirk's aim is to introduce a degree of coherence and of critical awareness into a subject that arouses profound interest today, but which for too long has been the target of excessive theorizing and interdisciplinary confusion between anthropologists, sociologists, classicists, philosophers and psychologists. Professor Kirk begins by discussing the relation of myths to rituals and folktales, and the weakness of universalist theories of function. He then subjects Lévi-Strauss's structuralist theory to an extended exposition and criticism; he considers the character and meaning of ancient Near Eastern myths, their influence on Greece, and the special forms with rational modes of thought, and finally, he assesses the status of myths as expressions of the unconscious, as elements of dreams, universal symbols, as accidents along the way to some narrative objective. The result is a significant critical venture into the history and philosophy of thought, imagination, symbol and society.--From publisher description.",5,N/A,en

The World of Classical Myth,"['Carl A. P. Ruck', 'Danny Staples']",1994,['Foreign Language Study'],"The in-depth and well researched material in The World of Classical Myth is presented against a background of history, archaeology, social custom, religion, topography, and monuments. Part One, ""Orientation,"" defines mythology and portrays it as an evolving pattern, constantly undergoing revision to keep pace with the evolution of the culture. Hence, mythology offers an archaeology of a people's changing sense of identity. Part Two, ""Transmutations,"" portrays symbolic forms as eternal and archetypal, never annihilated but merely changing appearance to meet the demands of changing times. Hence, the analysis of the iconography and worship of the twelve Olympian deities paints a picture of their evolution into their Classical identities. Part Three, ""The Liminal Hero,"" describes the two ways of telling a hero's story: either the hero steps forward to found a new world and defeat the past, or he steps back to become the fundament of his present world. Part Four, ""Liminal Heroines,"" delineates the three versions of the heroine's identity -- maiden, mother, and witch -- and explores the portrayal of women in classical mythology. Staples and Ruck follow these themes through the course of Classical Myth, incorporating over 100 illustrations and maps integral to the presentation of the material. The book also offers new perspectives on the goddesses and heroines of classical mythology and on the role of women in antiquity. ""It is indeed a cause for some alarm that so important a subject as Greek Mythology has hitherto lacked an adequate primary textbook... Ruck's book may well be the long-awaited remedy. I am impressed not only by his knowledge and organization, but also by his patent concern for student needs."" -- Professor C. Robert Phillips, III, Lehigh University",N/A,N/A,en

"Asklepios, Medicine, and the Politics of Healing in Fifth-Century Greece",['Bronwen L. Wickkiser'],2008,['History'],"Delving deeply into ancient medical history, Bronwen L. Wickkiser explores the early development and later spread of the cult of Asklepios, one of the most popular healing gods in the ancient Mediterranean. Though Asklepios had been known as a healer since the time of Homer, evidence suggests that large numbers of people began to flock to the cult during the fifth century BCE, just as practitioners of Hippocratic medicine were gaining dominance. Drawing on close readings of period medical texts, literary sources, archaeological evidence, and earlier studies, Wickkiser finds two primary causes for the cult’s ascendance: it filled a gap in the market created by the refusal of Hippocratic physicians to treat difficult chronic ailments and it abetted Athenian political needs. Wickkiser supports these challenging theories with side-by-side examinations of the medical practices at Asklepios' sanctuaries and those espoused in Hippocratic medical treatises. She also explores how Athens' aspirations to empire influenced its decision to open the city to the healer-god's cult. In focusing on the fifth century and by considering the medical, political, and religious dimensions of the cult of Asklepios, Wickkiser presents a complex, nuanced picture of Asklepios' rise in popularity, Athenian society, and ancient Mediterranean culture. The intriguing and sometimes surprising information she presents will be valued by historians of medicine and classicists alike.",N/A,N/A,en

Jung on Mythology,"['Carl Gustav Jung', 'Robert Alan Segal']",1998,['Fiction'],"At least three major questions can be asked of myth: what is its subject matter? What is its origin? What is its function? Theories of myth may differ in the answers they give to any of these questions, but more basically they may also differ on which of the questions they ask. C.G.

Bulfinch's Mythology,"['Thomas Bulfinch', 'Valerie Willis']",2020-08-24,['Fiction'],"Welcome to the Battle Goddess Edition of ""Bulfinch's Mythology"" by Thomas Bulfinch as revised by Rev. E.E. Hale. This is a cornerstone piece for anyone wanting to dive deeper into mythology of various kinds. Mr. Bulfinch does a wonderful job in making a collective account of stories for most of the entities he covers, including several excerpts from poets, historians, Milton, Homer, including his own brother, and many more. Traversing from Greek to Roman to Hindu to Celtic and beyond, this is a great book for any mythology lover. If this wasn't enticing enough, we added in the volumes of ""King Arthur and His Knights"" and even ""Legends of Charlemagne"" to give you an unforgettable resource and collection. The artwork found within is a collection of work from a mixture of artists from over a hundred years ago and older. A listing of artists can be found in the back matter so you may search for more of their work within our edition. Not all of the public domain images had the artist labelled, but we felt the ""unknown"" deserved to be shown off right along with the more well-known artists. The collective was known for illustrating fairy tales, mythology, or even prior versions of Bulfinch's own publications including Arthur Rackham, who is a personal favorite. --",N/A,N/A,en
Dionysus,['Walter F. Otto'],1965,['Philosophy'],"""Who is Dionysus? The god of ecstasy and terror, of wildness and of the most blessed deliverance, and the mad god whose appearance sends mankind into madness. In this classic study of the myth and cult of Dionysus, Walter F. Otto recreates the theological world of ancient Greek religion. Otto's provocative starting point is to accept the immanent reality of the gods. To understand the cult of Dionysus, it is necessary to reimagine the original vision of the god. Otto challenges us to understand the power of this vision not as a bloodless abstraction but as a force animating belief, to see the myth and art of Dionysus as a passionate search to regain the power of the lost gof.""--Back cover.",N/A,N/A,en

The Body of Myth,['J. Nigro Sansonese'],1994,['Health & Fitness'],"Long ago the ancestors of the Greeks, Romans, and Hindus were one people living on the Eurasian steppes. At the core of their religion was the ""shamanic trance,"" a natural state but one in which consciousness achieves a profound level of inner awareness. Over the course of millennia, the Indo-Europeans divided and migrated into Europe and the Indian subcontinent. The knowledge of shamanic trance retreated from everyday awareness and was carried on in the form of myths and distilled into spiritual practices--most notably in the Indian tradition of yoga. J. Nigro Sansonese compares the myths of Greece as well as those of the Judeo-Christian tradition with the yogic practices of India and concludes that myths are esoteric descriptions of what occurs within the human body, especially the human nervous system, during trance. In this light, the myths provide a detailed map of the shamanic state of consciousness that is our natural heritage. This book carries on from the works of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell to show how the portrayal of consciousness embodied in myth can be extended to a reappraisal of the laws of physics; before they are descriptions of the world, these laws--like myths--are descriptions of the human nervous system.",N/A,N/A,en

Artificial Mythologies,['Craig J. Saper'],1997,['Literary Criticism'],"Artificial Mythologies was first published in 1997. Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. Cultural critics teach us that myths are artificial. Cultural innovators use the artificial to make something new. In this exhilarating guide, Craig J. Saper takes us on an eye-opening tour of the process of cultural invention-willfully entertaining foolish, absurd, even fake, solutions as a way of reaching new perspectives on cultural problems. Saper deploys this method to reveal unsuspected connections among major cultural issues, such as urban decay, the dangers of television's power, family values, and conservative criticism of higher education. The model Saper uses builds on the later works of the revered French cultural critic Roland Barthes. These works, Saper argues, suggest poignant, playful, and productive ways of engaging dominant methodologies and mythologies. Artificial Mythologies shows us how, by allowing the artificial-our received ideas, common responses, and cultural mythologies-full play, we can arrive at provocative new solutions. The book demonstrates that the very conceptions of media and sociocultural issues that stymie innovation can be made to serve the cause of invention. Craig J. Saper is assistant professor in the Department of English at the University of Pennsylvania.",N/A,N/A,en

Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly recreating the characters -- the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to dupe others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions -- and making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.--",N/A,N/A,en
