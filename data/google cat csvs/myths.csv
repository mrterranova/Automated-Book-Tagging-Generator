Argonauts of the Western Pacific,['Bronislaw Malinowski'],1961,['Business & Economics'],"Bronislaw Malinowski, one of the all-time great anthropologists of the world, had a talent for bringing together in single comprehension the warm reality of human living with the cool abstractions of science. His pages have become an almost indispensable link between the knowing of exotic and remote people with theoretical knowledge about humankind. This volume¿originally published in 1922¿can be considered the founding document of economic anthropology, and remains the best one to read. It emphasizes the great significance of primitive economics by singling out the notable exchange system of the Trobriand Islands for special consideration. Although the main theme is economic, constant reference is made in this milestone of anthropological research and interpretation to social organization, life and meaning, the power of magic, and mythology and folklore.",N/A,N/A,en

In ""Iktomi and the Ducks,"" spider-trickster spirit Iktomi befriends a group of ducks by playing them music to dance to.

Stumbling across a deer carcass, he believes his prayers have been answered and prepares a fire to roast the deer meat over.

Everyone knows the story of Tutankhamun, but the ancient Egyptian civilization lasted for more than 3,000 years – which means there are loads more amazing tales to be told! Egyptologist and TikTok star Hugo Cook (aka Hugo the Egyptologist) has scoured ancient texts and translated hieroglyphs to bring readers stories of love, betrayal, and royal scandal featuring pharaohs, priests, gods, and goddesses. The book combines historical stories, including the time Cleopatra hid in a sack to be smuggled into a palace to meet Julius Caesar, with rip-roaring myths, like the Cinderella story of a peasant girl who married the pharaoh when he found her slipper. Told with great fun and impeccably researched, readers will slip into a tomb at night with a band of mischievous tomb robbers and witness epic battles featuring elephants and ostriches. Interspersed through the stories are pages explaining the history of ancient Egypt on the banks of the Nile, from how pyramids were built to a step-by-step guide to wrapping a mummy. With a beautiful cloth-textured cover featuring shiny foil, Tales of Ancient Egypt is the perfect gift for kids interested in ancient Egypt.",N/A,N/A,en

The Morrigan,['Kim Curran'],2025-02-06,['Fiction'],"UNLEASH THE MAGIC: Discover this fierce, witchy retelling of Irish mythology from an unforgettable new voice in mythic fiction 'If you want an epic tale of war and femininity, rage and its triumphs and consequences, this is a brilliant work of mythology, fantasy and history.' HANNAH KANER, author of Godkiller 'Beautifully fierce and unapologetically powerful . . . retells the darkly epic story of Ireland's goddess of war with unflinching detail and fiery prose' ROSIE HEWLETT, author of Medea Perfect for fans of Elodie Harper's The Wolf Den and Costanza Casati's Clytemnestra -- RULER. MOTHER. GODDESS. WARRIOR. They called me The Morrigan. I was magnificent. I was multitudes. They twisted my story, stripped me away. But I will tell it now in my own voice. It begins, as all the best stories do, in darkness. From an ancient, storm-tossed sea, a tribe of gods reach the rocky shores of Ireland. Among them, a strange, hungry, red-haired girl. A girl who can change shape, from bird to beast to goddess. A girl who dreams of battle, of blood, of death and power. She does not know yet that a woman who seeks to rule will always be in danger - or that there are far more treacherous figures in this land than the gods who raised her. She does not know that one day love will burn so deep in her heart that its scars will never heal. That she will know pain so raw and pure it will almost tear her apart. She does not know that her journey will take a thousand years. That her name will be remembered for a thousand more. She is The Morrigan, and she is waiting: a girl with rage coiled in her chest. Beautiful, powerful, ravenous rage. A rage that will live forever. An electric debut retelling of Ireland's mythic goddess of war, from a bold and powerful new voice. -- AUTHORS ARE ENCHANTED BY THE MORRIGAN 'Thrilling and bloody from first page to last, this is an extraordinary portrait of a goddess, a warrior, a woman.

Kim Curran is an astonishing talent' Kate Heartfield, author of The Valkyrie and The Embroidered Book 'Curran's The Morrigan will do for Irish mythology what Madeline Miller did for Greek...An absolute triumph' Amy McCulloch 'Transported back to ancient Ireland, The Morrigan took me on a breathtaking journey brimming with fury and longing. Captivated from start to finish, I dreamed of the Morrigan and her lust for vengeance long after I read the last page. Stunning!' Anya Bergman, author of The Witches of Vardø 'Breathtaking in scope, blistering in truth, The Morrigan is a beautifully dark tale of rage, power and love. Razor-sharp, profound and intensely moving, this is more than a retelling.I adored it!'

The Memoir of the Minotaur,['Tom Shachtman'],2020-09-24,['Fiction'],"The Memoir of the Minotaur is the posthumous confessions of the half-man, half-bull of Crete, as offered to an audience of recently-deceased, 21st century fellow souls in Hades' domain. This book is a satire for readers unafraid of a rollicking good tale involving anatomically-complex beings, unforgivable puns, the champion serial killer of all time, scantily-clad Greek maidens and youths, articulate tyrants, and feminist proto-history leavened with theological impertinence. The Memoir of the Minotaur shares its form with other popular retellings of the monster narrative such as John Gardner's Grendel, and the narrative voice has likenesses to the exuberance, bawdiness, and blasphemy of Salman Rushdie and John Barth. Packed with actions both big and small, while containing a breadth of complexity as it deals with themes of power, violence, sexuality, and the role of storytelling, its most endearing quality is the hilarity and absurdity of our classical values interacting with our animalistic cores. Ultimately, the book is riotous.",N/A,N/A,en

"Science, Bread, and Circuses",['Gregory Schrempp'],2014-11-15,['Social Science'],"In Science, Bread, and Circuses, Gregory Schrempp brings a folkloristic viewpoint to the topic of popular science, calling attention to the persistence of folkloric form, idiom, and worldview within the increasingly important dimension of popular consciousness defined by the impact of science. Schrempp considers specific examples of texts in which science interpreters employ folkloric tropes—myths, legends, epics, proverbs, spectacles, and a variety of gestures from religious tradition—to lend credibility and appeal to their messages. In each essay he explores an instance of science popularization rooted in the quotidian round: variations of proverb formulas in monumental measurements, invocations of science heroes like saints or other inspirational figures, the battle of mythos and logos in parenting and academe, how the meme has become embroiled in quasi-religious treatments of the problem of evil, and a range of other tropes of folklore drafted to serve the exposition of science. Science, Bread, and Circuses places the relationship of science and folklore at the very center of folkloristic inquiry by exploring a range of attempts to rephrase and thus domesticate scientific findings and claims in folklorically imbued popular forms.",N/A,N/A,en
