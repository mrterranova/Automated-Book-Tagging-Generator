Social Neuroscience,"['Russell K. Schutt', 'Larry J. Seidman', 'Matcheri S. Keshavan']",2015-06-09,['Medical'],"Human beings evolved in the company of others and flourish in proportion to their positive social ties. To understand the human brain, we must situate its biology in the wider context of society. To understand society, we must also consider how the brains and minds of individuals shape interactions with other human beings. Social Neuroscience offers a comprehensive new framework for studying the brain, human development, and human behavior. In this book, leading researchers in the fields of neurobiology, psychiatry, psychology, and sociology elucidate the connections between brain biology and the brain’s functioning in the social world, providing a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary explanation of how humans think and act, as well as the ways we define and treat pathological behavior. Synthesizing the insights and perspectives of these experts, Social Neuroscience examines how neural processes make the brain sensitive to social experience, how cognition shapes social behavior, and how social networks create a range of responses among different individuals to the same environmental stimuli. The mutually reinforcing connections between brain, mind, and society have profound implications for human health, from the emotionally damaging effects of severe social deprivation to the neurological impact of parental abuse and neighborhood violence. The authors explore these connections, with special focus on mental illnesses, including schizophrenia—a disorder characterized by marked social deficits in which a neurological basis is now well established.",N/A,N/A,en

The Psychotherapy of Hope,"['Renato D. Alarcón', 'Julia B. Frank']",2012-01-16,['Psychology'],"The then-controversial message of Jerome D. Frank's Persuasion and Healing (1991) was that ""the shared features of the various methods of psychological therapy are more important than those by which they differ."" Alarcon (emeritus, psychiatry, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine), a former student of Frank's, and Julia Frank (psychiatry and behavioral sciences, George Washington U. School of Medicine), his daughter/coauthor, introduce essays treating his book's themes (e.g., the importance of life history, meaning, cultural concepts, demoralization, the mind-body interface); its impact on current practices; relevance to neuroscience; and applications to special populations.

Quantitative Neuroscience,"['Panos M. Pardalos', 'J. Chris Sackellares', 'Paul R. Carney', 'Leon D. Iasemidis']",2004-01-31,['Computers'],"Advances in the field of signal processing, nonlinear dynamics, statistics, and optimization theory, combined with marked improvement in instrumenta tion and development of computers systems, have made it possible to apply the power of mathematics to the task of understanding the human brain. This verita ble revolution already has resulted in widespread availability of high resolution neuroimaging devices in clinical as well as research settings. Breakthroughs in functional imaging are not far behind. Mathematical tech niques developed for the study of complex nonlinear systems and chaos already are being used to explore the complex nonlinear dynamics of human brain phys iology. Global optimization is being applied to data mining expeditions in an effort to find knowledge in the vast amount of information being generated by neuroimaging and neurophysiological investigations. These breakthroughs in the ability to obtain, store and analyze large datasets offer, for the first time, exciting opportunities to explore the mechanisms underlying normal brain func tion as well as the affects of diseases such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, movement disorders, and cognitive disorders that affect millions of people every year. Ap plication of these powerful tools to the study of the human brain requires, by necessity, collaboration among scientists, engineers, neurobiologists and clini cians. Each discipline brings to the table unique knowledge, unique approaches to problem solving, and a unique language.",N/A,N/A,en

Concepts of Alzheimer Disease,"['Peter J. Whitehouse', 'Konrad Maurer', 'Jesse F. Ballenger']",2000,['Family & Relationships'],"The origin of this collection of essays was a 1997 symposium held to celebrate the life, legacy, and work of Alois Alzheimer, who described the disease in 1907. One of the first chapters of the book tells the fascinating story of how the case notes for Alzheimer's article were recently discovered in the archives of his department in Frankfurt. In a book focused on the history of Alzheimer's disease, we can see the evolution of our concepts of this disease. It was described clinically at first and then pathologically. In the 1970s and 1980s, the disorder was viewed as a neurochemical entity (the cholinergic hypothesis). Today, we consider Alzheimer's disease a genetic disorder (related to chromosomes and apolipoprotein E). How will we view it in the future?",N/A,N/A,en

MATLAB for Neuroscientists,[],2009,['Computers'],"Matlab is the accepted standard for scientific computing, used globally in virtually all Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology laboratories. For instance, SPM, the most used software for the analysis and manipulation of fMRI images in research and clinical practice is fully programmed in matlab, and its use of the possibility to allow for sophisticated software modules to be freely added to the software has established it as the by far dominant software in the field. Many universities now offer, or are beginning to offer matlab introductory courses in their neuroscience and psychology programs. Nevertheless, so far there hasn't been a textbook specific to this market, and the use of the plethora of existing engineering focused Matlab textbooks is notoriously difficult for teaching the package in those environments. This is the first comprehensive teaching resource and textbook for the teaching of Matlab in the Neurosciences and in Psychology. Matlab is unique in that it can be used to learn the entire empirical and experimental process, including stimulus generation, experimental control, data collection, data analysis and modeling. Thus a wide variety of computational problems can be addressed in a single programming environment. The idea is to empower advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students by allowing them to design and implement their own analytical tools. As students advance in their research careers, they will have achieved the fluency required to understand and adapt more specialized tools as opposed to treating them as ""black boxes"". Virtually all computational approaches in the book are covered by using genuine experimental data that are either collected as part of the lab project or were collected in the labs of the authors, providing the casual student with the look and feel of real data. In some rare cases, published data from classical papers are used to illustrate important concepts, giving students a computational understanding of critically important research. The ability to effectively use computers in research is necessary in an academic environment that is increasingly focused on quantitative issues. Matlab represents an ideal language of scientific computing. It is based on powerful linear algebra structures which lend themselves to empirical problems on the one hand, while at the same time allowing the student to make rapid problem-oriented progress (particularly in terms of visualization of data points) without having to lose focus by worrying too much about memory allocation and other ""plumbing"" minutiae as would be required in other, more low-level programming languages such as C or C++. Currently, there are several books that provide introductions to Matlab that are either too generic and fundamental or too irrelevant for neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists who typically face a very circumscribed range of problems in data collection, data analysis and signal processing. Some non-book tutorials and primers that are in use in the community are typically out of date. Matlab versions are usually not backwards compatible. Many commands and functions used in older tutorials and primers, such as ""flops"" won't work in current versions of Matlab, necessitating a book that is timely and up-to-date. The complete lack of a relevant resource in this area, combined with a clearly felt need for such a text provided the primary and initial impetus for this project. The authors provide such a dearly needed resource adapting and pooling materials that developed for and used in highly rated courses involving the use of Matlab in Neuroscience at the University of Chicago.",N/A,N/A,en
Essays on Neuroscience and Political Theory,['Frank Vander Valk'],2012,['Biopolitics'],"Climate change creates unprecedented problems of intergenerational justice. What do members of the current generation owe to future generations in virtue of the contribution they are making to climate change? Providing important new insights within the theoretical framework of political liberalism, Climate Change and Future Justice presents arguments in three key areas: Mitigation: the current generation ought to adopt a strong precautionary principle in formulating climate change policy in order to minimise the risks of serious harm from climate change imposed on future generations Adaptation: the current generation ought to create a fund to which members of future generations may apply for compensation if the risks of climate change harm imposed on them by the current generation ripen into harms Triage: future generations ought to keep alive hope for a return to the framework of justice for the social cooperation of future people less burdened by climate change harms. This work presents agenda-setting applications of important principles of democratic equality to the most serious set of political challenges ever faced by human society. It should be required reading for political theorists and environmental philosophers.",N/A,N/A,en

"Systemic, Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Physiological Functions and Their Disorders","[""Nodar Prokof'evich Mitagvariia"", 'Nargiz G. Nachkebia']",2018,['Medical'],"The I. Beritashvili Center of Experimental Biomedicine was established in 2010 on the basis of merging four well-known Georgian research institutes. They are: The I. Beritashvili Institute of Physiology, one of the most prominent research centers of Georgia, where basic and applied research in different fields of neurophysiology has been conducted since 1935; the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics; the Center for Radiology and Radiation Ecology, which for many years operated as departments at the I. Beritashvili Institute of Physiology; and one of the leading research centers for Georgia: The Center of Experimental Neurology.This edited book is the second volume containing chapters constituting the research priorities of the I. Beritashvili Center of Experimental Biomedicine and covers the experimental study of fundamental issues in the functioning of physiological (mainly, neurophysiological) mechanisms during normal and pathological conditions. The first book - Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Physiological Functions and Their Disorders - published by Nova Science Publishers Inc. in 2015, was also devoted to the same general problems.In the present edited book, particular attention is drawn to the study of extremely important processes underlying the basic mechanisms and disorders of various phenomenon of integrative activity of the brain: General behavior, learning and memory processes, the sleep-wakefulness cycle, regulation of adequate blood supply, hormesis, vision, depression, experimental comatose state, epilepsy, tumor diseases, pain and analgesia, the state of anxiety and aggression. All of the mentioned processes are studied on the molecular, cellular and systemic levels of their organization. It has to be noted herewith that each chapter within the collection of works represents the results of separate, independent studies implemented by different scientific departments of the Center; therefore, the chapters are not directly related to each other and have been arranged alphabetically based on the surnames of the authors. The authors would like to take this opportunity and present to the reader the scientific and institutional infrastructure of the Center, which consists of departments and laboratories.Nowadays, the Center is comprised of seven departments: Neurophysiology, Membranology, Biochemistry, Blood Circulation and Metabolism, Neurotoxicology, Biophysics and Radiobiology and nine laboratories: Behavior and Cognitive Functions, Physiology of Vision, Neurobiology of Sleep-Wakefulness Cycle, Ultra- and Nanoarchitectonics of the Brain, Experimental Neurology, Pain and Analgesia, Bioinformatics, Structure and Function of Genomes, and the Problems of Radiation Safety.In addition to bilateral scientific cooperation with many famous European and American scientific institutions, the Center is a member of the International Science Consortium ""From Molecular to Cellular Events in Human Pathologies"", of which the 2015 Annual Meeting was held in Tbilisi.The authors are sure that readers are fully aware of the theoretical and practical importance of the research related to problems of systemic, cellular and molecular mechanisms of physiological functions and their disorders.
