Terrors of the Table,['Walter Gratzer'],2005-09-29,['Health & Fitness'],"Terrors of the Table is an absorbing account of the struggle to find the necessary ingredients of a healthy diet, and the fads and quackery that have always waylaid the unwary and the foolish when it comes to the matter of food and health. Walter Gratzer tells the tale of nutrition's heroes, heroines and charlatans with characteristic crispness and verve. We find an array of colourful personalities, from the distinguished but quarrelsome Liebig, to the enterprising LydiaPinkham. But we also find the slow recognition that the lack of vital ingredients can cause terrible illnesses - scurvy, rickets, beriberi. These diseases stalked the poor in the West even into the 20th century, and scandalously remain in poorer parts of the world today. The narrative stretches from classicaltimes to the modern day and gives a valuable historical perspective to our current understanding. It also highlights some of the problems faced by the developed world regarding health today - in particular diabetes and obesity. And despite our far greater understanding of what our body needs, there are still many who would fall for fads and fancy diets - some dangerous, others just daft.Of course, the story of nutrition does not end there. We have discovered the key vitamins and minerals our body needs, but research continues on the connections between diet, health and disease. The body's biochemistry is complex, and there are no easy answers, no magic formula, that applies to all individuals. The safest and most rational course would seem to be a sensible, moderate, and varied diet, not forgetting that 'a little of what you fancy does you good'.",4,N/A,en
Nutrition and Infectious Diseases,"['Debbie L. Humphries', 'Marilyn E. Scott', 'Sten H. Vermund']",2020-12-10,['Medical'],"This comprehensive and user-friendly volume focuses on the intersection between the fields of nutrition and infectious disease. It highlights the importance of nutritional status in infectious disease outcomes, and the need to recognize the role that nutrition plays in altering the risk of exposure and susceptibility to infection, the severity of the disease, and the effectiveness of treatment. Split into four parts, section one begins with a conceptual model linking nutritional status and infectious diseases, followed by primers on nutrition and immune function, that can serve as resources for students, researchers and practitioners. Section two provides accessible overviews of major categories of pathogens and is intended to be used as antecedents of pathogen-focused subsequent chapters, as well as to serve as discrete educational resources for students, researchers, and practitioners. The third section includes five in-depth case studies on specific infectious diseases where nutrition-infection interactions have been extensively explored: diarrheal and enteric disease, HIV and tuberculosis, arboviruses, malaria, and soil-transmitted helminths. The final section addresses cross-cutting topics such as drug-nutrient interactions, co-infections, and nutrition, infection, and climate change and then concludes by consolidating relevant clinical and public health approaches to addressing infection in the context of nutrition, and thus providing a sharp focus on the clinical relevance of the intersection between nutrition and infection Written by experts in the field, Nutrition and Infectious Diseases will be a go to resource and guide for immunologists, clinical pathologists, sociologists, epidemiologists, nutritionists, and all health care professionals managing and treating patients with infectious diseases.",N/A,N/A,en
Clinical Nutrition of the Essential Trace Elements and Minerals,"['John D. Bogden', 'Leslie M.

Magnesium in Human Health and Disease,"['Ronald Ross Watson', 'Victor R. Preedy', 'Sherma Zibadi']",2012-09-14,['Medical'],"Magnesium is an essential mineral which is required for growth and survival of humans. Since magnesium is a mineral and not synthesizable it must be obtained through dietary foods and/or supplements. Magnesium in Human Health and Disease reviews the benefits of magnesium supplementation to reach recommended intakes as well as provides new research that suggests how reaching levels above the recommended intakes can promote health and treat various diseases. Magnesium deficiency can cause low serum potassium and calcium levels, retention of sodium, and low circulating levels of regulatory hormones. These changes in nutrients cause neurological and muscular symptoms such as tremor and muscle spasms. Further magnesium deficiency causes loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, personality changes and death from heart failure. Causes of magnesium deficiency include alcohol abuse, poorly controlled diabetes, excessive or chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea. Thus the effects of inadequate and deficient intakes or levels of magnesium is critical to health and are reviewed by the expert clinicians in this book. Magnesium in Human Health and Disease provides the most current research to support the potential benefits or lack thereof for normal and high supplementation with magnesium. Animal model research and early human trials are reviewed to document other disease states such as hypertension, cholesterol level, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease that would benefit from increased magnesium.",N/A,N/A,en

Selenium,['Dolph L. Hatfield'],2012-12-06,['Medical'],"As discussed in this book, a large body of evidence indicates that selenium is a cancer chemopreventive agent. Further evidence points to a role of this element in reducing viral expression, in preventing heart disease, and other cardiovascular and muscle disorders, and in delaying the progression of AIDS in HIV infected patients. Selenium may also have a role in mammalian development, in male fertility, in immune function and in slowing the aging process. The mechanism by which selenium exerts its beneficial effects on health may be through selenium-containing proteins. Selenium is incorporated into protein as the amino acid selenocysteine. Selenocysteine utilizes a specific tRNA, a specific elongation factor, a specific set of signals, and the codeword, UGA, for its cotranslational insertion into protein. It is indeed the 21st naturally occurring amino acid to be incorporated into protein and marks the first and only expansion of the genetic code since the code was deciphered in the mid 1960s.",N/A,N/A,en

Handbook of Growth and Growth Monitoring in Health and Disease,['Victor R. Preedy'],2011-12-03,['Medical'],"Growth is one of the human body’s most intricate processes: each body part or region has its own unique growth patterns. Yet at the individual and population levels, growth patterns are sensitive to adverse conditions, genetic predispositions, and environmental changes. And despite the body’s capacity to compensate for these developmental setbacks, the effects may be far-reaching, even life-long. The Handbook of Growth and Growth Monitoring in Health and Disease brings this significant and complex field together in one comprehensive volume: impact of adverse variables on growth patterns; issues at different stages of prenatal development, childhood, and adolescence; aspects of catch-up growth, endocrine regulation, and sexual maturation; screening and assessment methods; and international perspectives. Tables and diagrams, applications to other areas of health and disease, and summary points help make the information easier to retain. Together, these 140 self-contained chapters in 15 sections [ok?] cover every area of human growth, including: Intrauterine growth retardation. Postnatal growth in normal and abnormal situations. Cells and growth of tissues. Sensory growth and development. Effects of disease on growth. Methods and standards for assessment of growth, and more. The Handbook of Growth and Growth Monitoring in Health and Disease is an invaluable addition to the reference libraries of a wide range of health professionals, among them health scientists, physicians, physiologists, nutritionists, dieticians, nurses, public health researchers, epidemiologists, exercise physiologists, and physical therapists. It is also useful to college-level students and faculty in the health disciplines, and to policymakers and health economists.",N/A,N/A,en

Diet for a Large Planet,['Chris Otter'],2023-06-05,['History'],"""In this magisterial study, Chris Otter traces Britain's transition to a diet rich in animal proteins and refined carbohydrates like wheat and sugar, a diet that required more acreage than that of Britain itself and that, if followed everywhere, would soon deplete the planet's resources-as the title announces, this was truly a ""diet for a large planet."" From the late 1700s to the end of World War II, Otter accounts for the structures, practices, and ideologies generated by Britain's nutrition transition. He shows how Britain was the first nation to undergo the population explosion, urbanization, and industrialization we associate with modernity, and how it managed the unprecedented problem of how to feed its growing population. Its radical solution would be to outsource its food production, leading away from a locally produced, plant-based diet to one reliant on global markets, international trade networks, and enormous agro-food systems that would have planetary effects on famine, war, the world economy, and the wider earth-system. Not only did this phase in Britain's history make the consumption of meat, white bread, sugar, and butter a coveted diet, linked to development, luxury, and power--it also opened up a new phase in economic history, one whose dramatic effects endure to this day, whether in terms of health problems, eating disorders, or the seemingly endless world food crisis""--",N/A,N/A,en

Handbook of Drug'Nutrient Interactions,"['Joseph I. Boullata', 'Vincent T. Armenti']",2004-04-17,['Medical'],"Although there is agreat deal ofliterature regarding drug-nutrientinteractions (DNis ), there are limited sources of up-to-date comprehensive information. The Handbook of Drug-Nutrient Interactions admirably fills this gap. The editors, Dr. Joseph 1. Boullata and Dr. Vincent T. Armenti, ha ve a wealth of experience in this therapeutic ar ea and ha ve assembled a fine cadre of chapter authors who have individually contributed their high level of expertise. As treatment for many diseases becomes increasingly complex with multiple drug therapies scheduled at varying times, the need to identify clinically significant DNis is an essential part of medication management. This is a shared responsibility between health care professionals to interpret available data and individualize an approach to therapy that is compatible with the patient' s disease state, life stage, and dietary intake. Awareness ofthe significance of drug-food interactions is generally lacking. Although many texts contain lengthy lists of possible interactions, few data are provided for the clinician to gain an understanding of the mechanism of action of the interaction and subsequently apply the information to a particular patient or group of patients. For example, in the management of patients with HN -AIDS who are taking complex prescribed drug regimens, herbal products, and nutritional supplements, many of which are affected by dietary intake, careful attention to D Nls is a critic al component of therapy. Clinicians need to take account of not only the well-documented interactions between drugs and nutrients, but also the less obvious effects on drug-nutrient disposition and metabolism.",N/A,N/A,en

Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals,['Rotimi E.

This is an emerging field in food science, in which such foods are usually accompanied by health claims for marketing purposes, such as a company's ‘cereal is a significant source of fiber. Studies have shown that an increased amount of fiber in one's diet can decrease the risk of certain types of cancer in individuals.’ Functional foods are sometimes called nutraceuticals, a portmanteau of nutrition and pharmaceutical, and can include food that has been genetically modified. The general category includes processed food made from functional food ingredients, or fortified with health-promoting additives, like ""vitamin-enriched"" products, and also fresh foods (e.g., vegetables) that have specific claims attached. Fermented foods with live cultures are often also considered to be functional foods with probiotic benefits.""",N/A,N/A,en

The Warrior Diet,['Ori Hofmekler'],2007-12-04,['Family & Relationships'],"Reshape your body and mind by eating light during the day and filling up at night—the core tenet of this revolutionary nutrition program based on survival science. Along with the many benefits of leisure-class living comes obesity and its attendant ailments. In The Warrior Diet, Ori Hofmekler looks not forward but backward for a solution—to the primal habits of early cultures such as nomads and hunter-gatherers, the Greeks, and the Romans. Based on survival science, this book proposes not ordinary dietary changes but rather a radical yet surprisingly simple lifestyle overhaul. Drawing on both scientific studies and historical data, Hofmekler argues that robust health and a lean, strong body can best be achieved by mimicking the classical warrior mode of cycling—working and eating sparingly (undereating) during the day and filling up at night. The Warrior Diet Nutritional Program and the Controlling Fatigue Training Program can literally reshape your body and mind by helping you to: • Find ideal fuel foods and food combinations to reduce body fat • Gain strength, speed, and resilience to fatigue through special drills There are also individual chapters on: • Preparing warrior meals and recipes • Sex drive, potency, and animal magnetism • Personalizing the diet for women Featuring forewords by Fit for Life author Harvey Diamond and Fat That Kills author Dr. Udo Erasmus, The Warrior Diet shows readers weary of fad diets how to attain enduring vigor, explosive strength, a better appearance, and increased vitality and health.",N/A,N/A,en
The Potato Crop,"['Hugo Campos', 'Oscar Ortiz']",2019-12-03,['Science'],"This book is open access under a CC BY 4.0 license. This book provides a fresh, updated and science-based perspective on the current status and prospects of the diverse array of topics related to the potato, and was written by distinguished scientists with hands-on global experience in research aspects related to potato. The potato is the third most important global food crop in terms of consumption. Being the only vegetatively propagated species among the world’s main five staple crops creates both issues and opportunities for the potato: on the one hand, this constrains the speed of its geographic expansion and its options for international commercialization and distribution when compared with commodity crops such as maize, wheat or rice. On the other, it provides an effective insulation against speculation and unforeseen spikes in commodity prices, since the potato does not represent a good traded on global markets. These two factors highlight the underappreciated and underrated role of the potato as a dependable nutrition security crop, one that can mitigate turmoil in world food supply and demand and political instability in some developing countries. Increasingly, the global role of the potato has expanded from a profitable crop in developing countries to a crop providing income and nutrition security in developing ones. This book will appeal to academics and students of crop sciences, but also policy makers and other stakeholders involved in the potato and its contribution to humankind’s food security.",N/A,N/A,en

This realiza tion helped tobring me to an understanding of why people didn't always eat what (I believed) was good for them, and why the patients I had seen in hospital as often as not had failed to follow the dietary advice I had so confidently given. When I entered the field of health education I quickly discovered the farnaus World Health Organization definition of health as being a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease. Health was a triangle -and I had been guilty of virtu ally ignoring two sides of that triangle. As I became involved in practical nutrition education initiatives the deficiencies of an approach based on giving information about nutrition and physical health became more and more apparent.

Nourishment,['Fred Provenza'],2018,['Health & Fitness'],"Reflections on feeding body and spirit in a world of change Animal scientists have long considered domestic livestock to be too dumb to know how to eat right, but the lifetime research of animal behaviorist Fred Provenza and his colleagues has debunked this myth. Their work shows that when given a choice of natural foods, livestock have an astoundingly refined palate, nibbling through the day on as many as fifty kinds of grasses, forbs, and shrubs to meet their nutritional needs with remarkable precision. In Nourishment Provenza presents his thesis of the wisdom body, a wisdom that links flavor-feedback relationships at a cellular level with biochemically rich foods to meet the body's nutritional and medicinal needs. Provenza explores the fascinating complexity of these relationships as he raises and answers thought-provoking questions about what we can learn from animals about nutritional wisdom. What kinds of memories form the basis for how herbivores, and humans, recognize foods? Can a body develop nutritional and medicinal memories in utero and early in life? Do humans still possess the wisdom to select nourishing diets? Or, has that ability been hijacked by nutritional ""authorities""? Consumers eager for a ""quick fix"" have empowered the multibillion-dollar-a-year supplement industry, but is taking supplements and enriching and fortifying foods helping us, or is it hurting us? On a broader scale Provenza explores the relationships among facets of complex, poorly understood, ever-changing ecological, social, and economic systems in light of an unpredictable future. To what degree do we lose contact with life-sustaining energies when the foods we eat come from anywhere but where we live? To what degree do we lose the mythological relationship that links us physically and spiritually with Mother Earth who nurtures our lives? Provenza's paradigm-changing exploration of these questions has implications that could vastly improve our health through a simple change in the way we view our relationships with the plants and animals we eat. Our health could be improved by eating biochemically rich foods and by creating cultures that know how to combine foods into meals that nourish and satiate. Provenza contends the voices of ""authority"" disconnect most people from a personal search to discover the inner wisdom that can nourish body and spirit. That journey means embracing wonder and uncertainty and avoiding illusions of stability and control as we dine on a planet in a universe bent on consuming itself.",N/A,N/A,en

Vitoria's political works are thus of great importance for an understanding both of the rise of modern absolutism, and the debate about the emergent imperialism of the European powers. His works are also unusually accessible, since they survive mainly in the form of 'relectiones', or summaries delivered at the end of his lecture courses on law and theology at the University of Salamanca.

The authors also address relevant concerns such as relative and absolute contraindications, range of tested doses (efficacious and safe), possible side effects and pharmacological interactions, and the scientific level of clinical evidence for each product. Despite the availability of a large number of nutraceuticals on the market, the same compound is often offered by different industries at different dosages and concentrations, with different titration and often with different suggestions of efficacy. Available academic books on nutraceuticals prioritize summarizing information or focus on the pharmacological aspects on cells or animals models rather than on proof in humans. The handbook takes a unique and practical approach intended to assist clinicians, pharmacologists, nutritionists, and dietitians considering prescribing nutraceuticals for therapeutic use. Renowned expert Professor Arrigo Cicero is known internationally for his work in nutraceuticals, and currently serves as President of the Italian Nutraceutical Society.",N/A,N/A,en
