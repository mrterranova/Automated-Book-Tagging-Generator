Sedimentary Basins,['Gerhard Einsele'],2012-12-06,['Science'],"The modern geological sciences are characterized by extraordinarily rapid progress, as well as by the development and application of numerous new and refined methods,most of them handling an enormous amount of data available from all the continents and oceans. Given this state of affairs, it seams inevitable that many students and professionals tend to become experts in relatively narrow fields and there by are in danger of losing a broad view of current knowledge. The abun dance of new books and symposium volumes testifies to this trend toward specialization. However, many geologic processes are complex and result from the interaction of many, seemingly unrelated, individual factors. This signifies that we still need generalists who have the broad overview and are able to evaluate the great variety of factors and processes controlling a geologic system, such as a sedimentary basin. In addition, this also means that cooperation with other disciplines in the natural sciences and engi neering is increasingly important. Modern text books providing this broad overview of the earth sciences are rare. Some are written by several authors together to make sure that all topics are treated properly. When individual authors write a book, they run the risk of creating a text that is less balanced, because they cannot avoid indulging their own preferences for specific topics and field examples. However, this disadvantage can be compensated for by the fact that just one author can produce a more concise and uniform text and include ap propriate cross references.",N/A,N/A,en

Stable Isotope Geochemistry,['Jochen Hoefs'],2009-01-13,['Science'],"Stable Isotope Geochemistry is an introduction to the use of stable isotopes in the geosciences. It is subdivided into three parts: theoretical and experimental principles; fractionation processes of light and heavy elements; the natural variations of geologically important reservoirs. Since the application of stable isotopes to earth sciences has grown in the last few years, a new edition appears necessary. Recent progress in analysing the rare isotopes of certain elements for instance allow the distinction between mass-dependent and mass-independent fractionations. Special emphasis has been given to the growing field of ""heavy"" elements. Many new references have been added, which will enable quick access to recent literature. For students and scientists alike the book will be a primary source of information with regard to how and where stable isotopes can be used to solve geological problems.",5,N/A,en

Ecological Geography of the Sea,['Alan R. Longhurst'],1998,['Science'],"This book presents an in-depth discussion of the biological and ecological geography of the oceans. It synthesizes locally restricted studies of the ocean to generate a global geography for the vast marine world. It attempts to divide the ocean into distinguishable regions that permit detailed comparisons. Based on patterns of algal ecology, the book divides the ocean into four primary compartments, which are then subdivided into secondary compartments. The secondary compartments are identified and characterized by biogeochemical features including nutrient dynamics, continental shelf topography, and algal blooms. Because ocean-wide regional classification has broad impact on the way oceanographers and ecologists study ocean patterns, this book should have wide and long-term appeal.",N/A,N/A,en
Physical Geodesy,"['Bernhard Hofmann-Wellenhof', 'Helmut Moritz']",2006-10-10,['Science'],"""Physical Geodesy"", published in 1967, has for many years been considered as the standard introduction to its field.

Turbulence in Fluids,['Marcel Lesieur'],2012-12-06,['Science'],"Turbulence is a dangerous topic which is often at the origin of serious fights in the scientific meetings devoted to it since it represents extremely different points of view, all of which have in common their complexity, as well as an inability to solve the problem. It is even difficult to agree on what exactly is the problem to be solved. Extremely schematically, two opposing points of view have been ad vocated during these last twenty years: the first one is ""statistical"", and tries to model the evolution of averaged quantities of the flow. This com munity, which has followed the glorious trail of Taylor and Kolmogorov, believes in the phenomenology of cascades, and strongly disputes the possibility of any coherence or order associated to turbulence. On the other bank of the river stands the ""coherence among chaos"" community, which considers turbulence from a purely deterministic po int of view, by studying either the behaviour of dynamical systems, or the stability of flows in various situations. To this community are also associated the experimentalists who seek to identify coherent structures in shear flows.",N/A,N/A,en

The Earth's Hydrological Cycle,"['L. Bengtsson', 'R.-M. Bonnet', 'M. Calisto', 'G. Destouni', 'R. Gurney', 'J. Johannessen', 'Y. Kerr', 'W.A. Lahoz', 'M. Rast']",2014-05-02,['Science'],"This book gives a comprehensive presentation of our present understanding of the Earth's Hydrological cycle and the problems, consequences and impacts that go with this topic. Water is a central component in the Earth's system. It is indispensable for life on Earth in its present form and influences virtually every aspect of our planet's life support system. On relatively short time scales, atmospheric water vapor interacts with the atmospheric circulation and is crucial in forming the Earth's climate zones. Water vapor is the most powerful of the greenhouse gases and serves to enhance the tropospheric temperature. The dominant part of available water on Earth resides in the oceans. Parts are locked up in the land ice on Greenland and Antarctica and a smaller part is estimated to exist as groundwater. If all the ice over the land and all the glaciers were to melt, the sea level would rise by some 80 m. In comparison, the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is small; it amounts to ~ 25 kg/m2, or the equivalent of 25 mm water for each column of air. Yet atmospheric water vapor is crucial for the Earth’s energy balance. The book gives an up to date presentation of the present knowledge.

Photographic Atlas of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge Rift Valley,"['R. D. Ballard', 'J. G.

But modern oceanographic research is revealing that each part of the sea floor has its own characteristic features and is as distinct as the geologic and topographic provinces on land. The deep ocean floor holds the same fascination for us as unexplored mountain tops, jungles, or the surface of the moon and planets. And, since the oceans cover more than 70 percent of the earth's surface, the ocean floor holds the key to much of the history and evolution of our earth. There are very few places in the depths of the ocean that have been explored and studied directly by man, and to which man can relate in the way he relates to the earth on land.

The Empty Sea,"['Ilaria Perissi', 'Ugo Bardi']",2021-02-12,['Science'],"The “Blue Economy” is used to describe all of the economic activities related to the sea, with a special emphasis on sustainability. Traditional activities such as fisheries, but also undersea mining, tourism, and scientific research are included, as well as the phenomenal growth of aquaculture during the past decade. All of these activities, and the irresistible prospect of another new frontier, has led to enthusiastic and, most likely, overenthusiastic assessments of the possibilities to exploit the sea to feed the world, provide low-cost energy, become a new source of minerals, and other future miracles. This book makes sense of these trends and of the future of the blue economy by following our remote ancestors who gradually discovered the sea and its resources, describing the so-called fisherman’s curse – or why fishermen have always been poor, explaining why humans tend to destroy the resources on which we depend, and assessing the realistic expectations for extracting resources from the sea. Although the sea is not so badly overexploited as the land, our demands on ecosystem services are already above the oceans’ sustainability limits. Some new ideas, including “fishing down” for untapped resources such as plankton, could lead to the collapse of the entire marine ecosystem. How Neanderthals crossed the sea in canoes, how it was possible for five men on a small boat to kill a giant whale, what kind of oil the virgins of the Gospel put into their lamps, how a professor of mathematics, Vito Volterra, discovered the “equations of fishing,” why it has become so easy to be stung by a jellyfish while swimming in the sea, and how to play “Moby Dick,” a simple board game that simulates the overexploitation of natural resources are just some of the questions that you will be able to answer after reading this engaging and insightful book about the rapidly expanding relationship between humanity and the sea.",N/A,N/A,en

It then goes on to progressively smaller spatial and time scales – from the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Asian Monsoon, down to tropical waves, hurricanes, sea breezes, and tropical squall lines. The emphasis in most chapters is on the observational aspects of the phenomenon in question, the theories regarding its nature and maintenance, and the approaches to its numerical modeling. The concept of scale interactions is also presented as a way of gaining insight into the generation and redistribution of energy for the maintenance of oscillations of a variety of spatial and temporal scales.",N/A,N/A,en

Goods and services derived from coastal systems depend strongly on multiple transboundary interactions with the land, atmosphere, open ocean and sea bottom. Increasing demands on coastal resources driven by human habitation, food security, recreation and transportation accelerate the exploitation of the coastal landscape and water bodies. Many coastal areas and human activities are subject to increasing risks from natural and man-induced hazards such as flooding resulting from major changes in hydrology of river systems that has reached a global scale. Changes in the hydrological cycle coupled with changes in land and water management alter fluxes of materials transmitted from river catchments to the coastal zone, which have a major effect on coastal ecosystems.

Yet this multidimensional history remains largely unrevealed by its successive protagonists. Intrigued by the absence of a holistic portrayal of this body of water and inspired by Fernand Braudel’s famous work on the Mediterranean, this book brings alive a dynamic Red Sea world across time, revealing the particular features of a unique historical actor. In capturing this heretofore lost space, it also presents a critical, conceptual history of the sea, leading the reader into the heart of Eurocentrism. The Sea, it is shown, is a vital element of the modern philosophy of history. Alexis Wick is not satisfied with this inclusion of the Red Sea into history and attendant critique of Eurocentrism. Contrapuntally, he explores how the world and the sea were imagined differently before imperial European hegemony. Searching for the lost space of Ottoman visions of the sea, The Red Sea makes a deeper argument about the discipline of history and the historian’s craft.",N/A,N/A,en

Oceanography,"['C. P. Summerhayes', 'S. A. Thorpe']",1996,['Science'],"Oceans cover over 70% of the Earth’s surface and are essential to life on this planet. And yet it is only recently that the science and technology of Oceanography has matured - indeed, astronauts walked on the surface of the Moon before scientists explored the Mid-Ocean Ridge, a great mountain range that covers close to 23% of the Earth’s total surface area! Oceanography provides the basis for understanding the oceans’ complexities, and an appreciation of the importance of recent discoveries (the volcanism and hydrothermal circulation within the Mid-Ocean Ridge) and improved sampling techniques (advanced remotely operated vehicle systems and satellite monitoring). It is written by expert teachers and leading researchers in each of the many aspects of Oceanography: Weather Systems; Physical Geography; Chemistry; Biology; Measurement Techniques; Economics. Oceanography is an authoritative, comprehensive, easy to read and richly illustrated guide to this vast and fascinating subject. It is essential reading for anyone interested in the oceans - crucial to our future, but as yet barely explored. Contributors M. V. Angel J. M. Bull J. D. Burton H. Charnock K. J. Collins M. B.

Physical Oceanography of the Baltic Sea,"['Matti Leppäranta', 'Kai Myrberg']",2009-01-12,['Science'],"The Baltic Sea oceanographic research community is wide and the research history is over 100 years old. Nevertheless, there is still no single, coherent book on the physical oceanography of the Baltic Sea as a whole. There is a strong need for such a book, coming from working oceanographers as well as the university teaching programmes in advanced undergraduate to graduate levels. In the regional conference series in physical oceanography (Baltic Sea Science Conference, Baltic Sea Oceanographers' conference, Baltex-conferences) about 500 scientists take part regularly. Even more scientists work in the fields of marine biology, chemistry and the environment, and they need information on the physics of the Baltic Sea as well. There are nine countries bordering on the Baltic Sea and five more in the runoff area. The Baltic Sea as a source of fish, means of transportation and leisure activities is highly important to the regional society. In the runoff area there are a total of 85 million people. Research and protection strategies need to be developed, as the Baltic Sea is probably the most polluted sea in the world. Since the Baltic Sea has become an inner sea of the EU (apart from small shore parts of Russia in Petersburg and Kaliningrad), it is anticipated that the importance of the region will consequently rise. The book will arouse interest among students, scientists and decision makers involved with the Baltic problems. It will also give important background information for those working with biogeochemical processes in the Baltic Sea, because the physical forcing for those processes is of vital importance.",N/A,N/A,en

Modern Observational Physical Oceanography,['Carl Wunsch'],2015-05-04,['Science'],"The essential introduction to modern physical oceanography With the advent of computers, novel instruments, satellite technology, and increasingly powerful modeling tools, we know more about the ocean than ever before. Yet we also have a new generation of oceanographers who have become increasingly distanced from the object of their study. Ever fewer scientists collect the observational data on which they base their research. Instead, many download information without always fully understanding how far removed it is from the original data, with opportunity for great misinterpretation. This textbook introduces modern physical oceanography to beginning graduate students in marine sciences and experienced practitioners in allied fields. Real observations are strongly emphasized, as are their implications for understanding the behavior of the global ocean. Written by a leading physical oceanographer, Modern Observational Physical Oceanography explains what the observational revolution of the past twenty-five years has taught us about the real, changing fluid ocean. Unlike any other book, it provides a broad and accessible treatment of the subject, covering everything from modern methods of observation and data analysis to the fluid dynamics and modeling of ocean processes and variability. Fully illustrated in color throughout, the book describes the fundamental concepts that are needed before delving into more advanced topics, including internal-inertial waves, tides, balanced motions, and large-scale circulation physics.

World Atlas of the Oceans,[],2001,['Ocean'],"A monumental achievement in cartography that presents modern oceanography's most important discoveries for the first time Deep-sea exploration is one of the greatest achievements of 20th century science. But while expeditions made sensational news, they were isolated events, offering only a glimpse into a secret world complete with mountains, volcanoes, and a rich variety of animal life. It wasn't until after the Second World War - when the prominent sea-going nations decided to join forces and explore the planet's various oceanographic zones - that a more complete picture of the underwater world began to emerge. The result of this collaborative effort is a remarkable cartographic work compiled by the Canadian Hydrographic Service. The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) documents the depths of the world's oceans at all of their levels and gradations. In the World Atlas of the Oceans, these charts are available to the general public for the first time. Along with relief maps, illustrations and stunning photography, these remarkable charts help tell the story of Earth's oceans. From Australia's Great Barrier Reef to the Arctic's drifting icebergs, from the Atlantic's North-West Passage to the Pacific's sinking volcanoes, the World Atlas of the Oceans offers a comprehensive look at both the geological history of our oceans and their current incarnations. Detailed discussions of the ocean's animal life - sea cucumbers, whales, dolphins, giant squid - as well as underwater phenomena such as currents, tidal zones, ""black smokers,"" and fish graveyards are also included. Other features include: - bathymetric charts of all oceans, polar and inland seas - relief maps detailing the ocean floors - satellite images of the oceans and selected coastlines - previously unpublished charts of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea - information on currents, trade winds, mineral resources, major shipping routes, shallows and straits - more than 200 spectacular photographs and drawings The World Atlas of the Oceans is an important contribution to our understanding of the planet on which we live.

Guide to Process Based Modeling of Lakes and Coastal Seas,['Anders Omstedt'],2015-07-21,['Science'],"This new edition of Guide to Process Based Modeling of Lakes and Coastal Seas brings the modeling up to date, taking into account multiple stressors acting on aquatic systems. The combination of acidification and increasing amounts of anoxic waters associated with eutrophication puts severe stress on the marine environment. The detection and attribution of anthropogenic changes in coastal seas are therefore crucial and transparent modeling tools are increasingly important. Modeling the marine CO2–O2 system makes systematic studies on climate change and eutrophication possible and is fundamental for understanding the Earth system. This second edition also includes new sections on detection and attribution and on modeling future changes, as well as improved exercises, updated software, and datasets. This unique book will stimulate students and researchers to develop their modeling skills and make model codes and data transparent to other research groups. It uses the general equation solver PROBE to introduce process-oriented numerical modeling and to build understanding of the subject step by step. The equation solver has been used in many applications, particularly in Sweden and Finland with their numerous lakes, archipelago seas, fjords, and coastal zones. It has also been used for process studies in the Polar Seas and the Mediterranean Sea and the approach is suitable for applications in many other environmental applications. Guide to Process Based Modeling of Lakes and Coastal Seas: • is a unique teaching tool for systematic learning of aquatic modeling; • approaches lake and ocean modeling from a new angle; • introduces aquatic numerical modeling using a process-based approach; • enables the thorough understanding of the physics and biogeochemistry of lakes and coastal seas; • provides software, datasets, and algorithms needed to reproduce all calculations and results in the book; • provides a number of creative and stimulating exercises with solutions; • addresses the interaction between climate change and eutrophication and is a good basis for learning Earth System Sciences.",N/A,N/A,en

Frozen Oceans,['David Neville Thomas'],2004,['Nature'],"Discover and explore worlds containing unexpected life. As some scientists search for life on the frozen planet of Mars, others are discovering life in unexpected places here on Earth. Frozen Oceans follows the expeditions of polar scientists in the Arctic and Antarctic as they investigate the life found in and around the ice caps, which cover up to 13 percent of the Earth's surface. Every year during the harsh polar winter, the surface of the ocean freezes, forming a temporary ice layer called pack ice, or sea ice. The Antarctic is the site of the greatest seasonal event on Earth. In March, the air temperatures drop to as low as -40°F, the ocean, which turns to ice at 28.7°F, starts freezing at the incredible average rate of 2.22 square miles per minute! This is the first book to explain in non-technical terms and show with color photography the abundance of life on, in and under the ice. Topics include: The nature of pack ice Pack ice regions of the world Life within a block of ice Microbiology inside the ice Mammals, birds and ice. Scientists are continually being surprised by the abundance of life where no life was expected. For many years, ice was seen as an obstacle to exploration and a threat to life. The ice is now perceived as central to global ocean circulation as well as global climate patterns.

The deep ocean floor holds the same fascination for us as unexplored mountain tops, jungles, or the surface of the moon and planets.

Life and Death of Coral Reefs,['Charles Birkeland'],2012-10-12,['Science'],"Charles Birkeland Living coral is a thin veneer, measured in millimeters. Yet this thin film of living tissue has shaped the face of the Earth by creating limestone structures sometimes over 1,300 m thick from the surface down to its base on volcanic rock (Enewetak Atoll), or over 2,000 km long (Great Barrier Reef). About half the world's coastlines are in the tropics and about a third of the tropical coastlines are made of coral reef. Archipelagoes of hundreds of atolls such as the Marshalls, the Maldives, the Tuamotus, and most of the Carolines and Kiribati have been fonned by coral. In addition to enlarging high islands (such as the entire northern end of Guam) and extending and protecting coastlines, ancient biogenic reefs have fonned even larger areas on the present continents. Shallow living coral 2 reefs are estimated to presently cover over 600,000 km (Smith, 1978). Coral reefs are dynamic systems, producing limestone at the rate of 400-2,000 tons per hectare per year (Chave et aI. , 1972). The Great Barrier Reef dominates 2 230,000 km and has grown to this size in a geologically brief period of a few million years. Coral reefs influence the chemical balance of the world's oceans. Roughly half the calcium that enters the sea each year around the world, from the north to south poles, is taken up and temporarily bound into coral reefs (Smith, 1978).",N/A,N/A,en
Tropical Cyclones,['James P. Terry'],2007-09-20,['Science'],"accommodate terrestrial flooding. In consequence, although the natural vegetation may be severely damaged, tropical cyclones may have less geomorphic impact. Low coral islands, such as those that occur on atolls, have the most vulnerable physical environments of all. They are little more than unconsolidated heaps of coralline sands and gravels resting on reef foundations, and are especially prone to overtopping by storm surge and cyclone-driven waves. Associated sediment movement can produce rema- able changes – sometimes the complete obliteration of an island altogether, or on other occasions the creation of entirely new land. Island sensitivity to physical change is strongly conditioned by the degree to which the existing landscape is in dynamic equilibrium with the frequency of tropical cyclones. Walsh (1977) referred to this concept as ‘landscape eq- librium with the cyclone environment’. The idea is a simple one: a severe storm is more likely to produce catastrophic change on an island where one has not struck for a long time, since many of the geomorphic features are i- equipped to withstand the impact. In contrast, on islands where the effects of tropical cyclones have been felt more often, the contribution of an individual storm event to landscape change may be less significant. This is because the evolution of the island’s physical environment is in some degree of balance with regular climatic perturbations.",N/A,N/A,en
