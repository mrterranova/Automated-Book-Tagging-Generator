Maternity and Paternity at Work,"['Laura Addati', 'Naomi Cassirer', 'Katherine Gilchrist', 'International Labour Office']",2014,['Business & Economics'],"This report provides a picture of where we stand and what we have learned so far about maternity and paternity rights across the world. It offers a rich international comparative analysis of law and practice relating to maternity protection at work in 185 countries and territories, comprising leave, cash benefits, employment protection and non-discrimination, health protection, breastfeeding arrangements at work and childcare. Expanding on previous editions, it is based on an extensive set of new legal and statistical indicators, including coverage in law and in practice of paid maternity leave as well as statutory provision of paternity and parental leave and their evolution over the last 20 years. The report also takes account of the recent economic crisis and austerity measures. It shows how well national laws and practice conform to the ILO Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 (No. 183), its accompanying Recommendation (No. 191) and the Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention, 1981 (No. 156), and offers guidance on policy design and implementation. This report shows that a majority of countries have established legislation to protect and support maternity and paternity at work, even if those provisions do not always meet the ILO standards. One of the persistent challenges is the effective implementation of legislation, to ensure that all workers are able to benefit from these essential labour rights.",N/A,N/A,en

Young Mothers' Media Use,['Alysha Ashbourne'],2017,['Family and relationships'],"Although the effects of social media usage on the individual has been studied, the specific impact of social media use on young mothers has not directly been examined in a parenting context. The aim of this literature review was to explore the impact social media has on a young mother's parenting, with regard to their involvement and interaction with their child (ren). The variables associated with young mother's parenting and social media usage are parenting stress, parenting style, maternal satisfaction, and psychological well-being. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criterion and specifically examined social media usage by mothers. Results revealed an indirect relationship among parenting stress and the participation in social media sites. Mothers who used social media sites were likely to experience less parenting stress and more likely to build a social support system, however, higher rates of social media usage increased parenting stress. The results indicated that social media could potentially enhance or decrease mother-child interaction. The interaction is enhanced when mothers use social media for informative parental information. The mother-child interaction is decreased when mothers spend more time online and neglect childcare or household duties. As the cyberworld is constantly growing, this literature review aids in building a foundation for future research on young mothers' social media usage and parenting.",N/A,N/A,en
Are You Ready Now for Another Child?,['Francesca Luppi'],2014,"['Fertility, Human']","""The research aims to study the relationship between fertility and subjective wellbeing on a sample of Australian couples (source: HILDA 2001-2009), followed since the year of the pregnancy of the first child. In particular, I focus on whether the arrival of the first child modifies new parents' fertility expectations and the subsequent probability to experience a second childbirth, as a consequence of the changes in couple's subjective wellbeing after the transition to the first parenthood.""--Author abstract.",N/A,N/A,en

"Differences Between Assessments of Penalties in Ice Hockey by Referees, Coaches, Players, and Parents","['P. Trudel', 'D. Bernard', 'J-P Dionne']",2000,['Assessment'],"A video montage made up of 40 play sequences, presented on two different occasions, was used to compare referees, coaches, players, and parents on how they assess penalties in ice hockey. The results indicated that the four groups of subjects showed congruency and consistency in their decisions to give penalties. However, the referee group gave more importance to the context of the game and the behaviors of the victim when making decisions. The most interesting result was the large difference between decisions made by subjects in the study and decisions made by officials in the videotaped games. The authors concluded that during games, factors such as pressure from spectators and coaches, relationship established with the players, physical fatigue are factors that can bring the referees to shift from the constituent rules to the normative, unwritten rules.",N/A,N/A,en

Intervention Services for Parents of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),[],2015,['Autistic children'],"Objective: Parenting a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with increased stress and a decrease in parents'/caregivers' overall wellbeing (Benjak et al., 2009; Phetrasuwan & Shandor Milles, 2009).The objective of this study was to determine whether parents/caregivers of children with ASDs experience high levels of perceived stress and anxiety, to asses parents' coping, and their self-reported needs for supportive services and barriers to receive such services. Method: There were two parts to this cross sectional mixed method study. Study 1 involved a semi-structured interview with three service providers for families of children with ASD. Responses were qualitatively reported. In study 2, 59 parents/caregivers of children with ASD completed an anonymous online survey to assess parents/caregivers perceived stress (PSS), anxiety (SAS), and coping strategies (Brief COPE). Participants were largely women (89%) who self-identified as White (68%) or Hispanic (20%). Results: The results from study 2 showed that parents/caregivers of children with ASD have higher level of perceived stress, and mild to moderate levels of anxiety. There was a significant main effect of severity of diagnosis on parent stress. Parents with children who had a mild diagnosis reported significantly less perceived stress than parents with a child who had a severe diagnosis. Nearly half of parents/caregivers indicated that they would like to receive supportive service, including individual and group therapy. Financial limitations, lack of knowledge of services, and childcare were identified as the main barriers to attending services. Conclusion: Parents/caregivers of children with ASD are experiencing higher levels of stress and anxiety. The majority of parents/caregivers desire services. There is a gap in services that address parent/caregivers mental health, and to ensure the appropriate provision of mental health interventions, there is a great need to incorporate child and parent services in the same setting.",N/A,N/A,en
