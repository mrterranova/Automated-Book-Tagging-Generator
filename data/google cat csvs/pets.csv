Empire of Dogs,['Aaron Skabelund'],2011-12-15,['History'],"In 1924, Professor Ueno Eizaburo of Tokyo Imperial University adopted an Akita puppy he named Hachiko. Each evening Hachiko greeted Ueno on his return to Shibuya Station. In May 1925 Ueno died while giving a lecture. Every day for over nine years the Akita waited at Shibuya Station, eventually becoming nationally and even internationally famous for his purported loyalty. A year before his death in 1935, the city of Tokyo erected a statue of Hachiko outside the station. The story of Hachiko reveals much about the place of dogs in Japan's cultural imagination. In the groundbreaking Empire of Dogs, Aaron Herald Skabelund examines the history and cultural significance of dogs in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Japan, beginning with the arrival of Western dog breeds and new modes of dog keeping, which spread throughout the world with Western imperialism. He highlights how dogs joined with humans to create the modern imperial world and how, in turn, imperialism shaped dogs' bodies and their relationship with humans through its impact on dog-breeding and dog-keeping practices that pervade much of the world today. In a book that is both enlightening and entertaining, Skabelund focuses on actual and metaphorical dogs in a variety of contexts: the rhetorical pairing of the Western ""colonial dog"" with native canines; subsequent campaigns against indigenous canines in the imperial realm; the creation, maintenance, and in some cases restoration of Japanese dog breeds, including the Shiba Inu; the mobilization of military dogs, both real and fictional; and the emergence of Japan as a ""pet superpower"" in the second half of the twentieth century. Through this provocative account, Skabelund demonstrates how animals generally and canines specifically have contributed to the creation of our shared history, and how certain dogs have subtly influenced how that history is told. Generously illustrated with both color and black-and-white images, Empire of Dogs shows that human-canine relations often expose how people—especially those with power and wealth—use animals to define, regulate, and enforce political and social boundaries between themselves and other humans, especially in imperial contexts.",N/A,N/A,en

A Tale Of Two Cities,['Charles Dickens'],2020-11-20,[],"A Tale of Two Cities (1859) is a novel by Charles Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution. With well over 200 million copies sold, it ranks amongst the most famous works in the history of literary fiction. The novel depicts the plight of the French peasantry demoralised by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution, the corresponding brutality demonstrated by the revolutionaries toward the former aristocrats in the early years of the revolution, and many unflattering social parallels with life in London during the same time period. It follows the lives of several characters through these events. The 45-chapter novel was published in 31 weekly instalments in Dickens's new literary periodical titled All the Year Round.

The Macmillan Book of the Marine Aquarium,['Nick Dakin'],1992,['Pets'],"Sea water covers nearly three quarters of the Earth's surface and the wealth of life that it supports is astounding in its diversity. The often vividly colorful fishes and strange and intriguing invertebrates of the coral reef world are certainly captivating, and more and more aquarists are turning their attention to them. The appeal of the marine aquarium lies not only in the beauty of its inhabitants, however, but also in the challenge it presents to the aquarist - the most spectacular species are often also the most difficult to keep. For those willing to accept this challenge, this definitive reference book will prove an invaluable tool in helping to ensure success in a very rewarding hobby. The book is divided into six main parts. The first examines life on the reef, provides an insight into fish anatomy and studies the various major groups (phyla) of invertebrates that are of interest to the aquarist. This section closes with an informative look at the topical issues of collection and conservation. Part Two gives practical advice on setting up a marine aquarium, from exploring the options to the final preparations for the tank's inhabitants, while Part Three focuses on how to choose species and maintain them in the aquarium. Parts Four and Five feature fully illustrated surveys of the many different species of fish and invertebrates (respectively) suitable for the home aquarium. An increasingly popular area of the hobby - the coldwater marine aquarium - is explored in Part Six, which also suggests a number of suitable species. Finally, the book contains two appendices: on tropical marine algae and on species to avoid.",N/A,N/A,en

"Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition",['Adam Miklosi'],2007-11-29,['Pets'],"This is the first book to collate and synthesise the recent burgeoning primary research literature on dog behaviour, evolution and cognition. The author presents a new ecological approach to the understanding of dog behaviour, demonstrating how dogs can be the subject of rigorous and productive scientific study without the need to confine them to a laboratory environment. Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition starts with an overview of the conceptual and methodological issues associated with the study of the dog, followed by a brief description of their role in human society - almost a third of human families share their daily life with the dog! An evolutionary perspective is then introduced with a summary of current research into the process of domestication. The central part of the book is devoted to issues relating to the cognitive aspects of behaviour which have received particular attention in recent years from both psychologists and ethologists. The book's final chapters introduce the reader to many novel approaches to dog behaviour, set in the context of behavioural development and genetics. Directions for future research are highlighted throughout the text which also incorporates links to human and primate research by drawing on homologies and analogies in both evolution and behaviour. The book will therefore be of relevance and use to anyone with an interest in behavioural ecology including graduate students of animal behaviour and cognition, as well as a more general audience of dog enthusiasts, biologists, psychologists and sociologists.",N/A,N/A,en

All Things Wise and Wonderful,['James Herriot'],1981-07,['Biography & Autobiography'],"James Herriot is probably the most beloved living writer. When All Things Bright and Beautiful was published three years ago, it became the number one best seller in the world, winning still new friends for the Yorkshire veterinarian whose first book All Creatures Great and Small had already been enjoyed by millions of readers. In this, his third book, he takes up where he left off-- both in terms of the warmth, humor, and skill with which he writes, and in the story itself. It is World War Two and James has just been inducted into the RAF. We see him at training camp and we go back to Yorkshire-- on real trips as he breaks away to see Helen who is about to have a baby, and on trips of reverie as he recalls the Dales, the animals, and the Yorkshire people who have so enriched his life. We meet old friends again-- his partner Siegfried, the zany Tristan, the bon vivant Granville Bennett-- and scores of new folk, each with a story to tell.

It emphasizes all that really matters in life through simple truths from our everyday lives. The Wisdom of Aramis provides us with profound messages drawn from the lessons we can learn from our best friends and most devoted companions, our furry angels. It is a book dedicated to the author’s beloved pug, Aramis Giving of Good, who will always stay in her heart and who will fill the hearts of the readers with such a great sentiment of love, peace, tolerance, and compassion. The book talks about the joy of unconditional love, about deep compassion and inner peace, about the importance of acceptance and sincere kindness, about the magic of patience and miraculous coincidences. The book gives us the chance to discover a better world and a better version of ourselves through our self-awareness through which we can truly get to know ourselves, find our place in this world and beyond, and live in perfect harmony with nature and the entire universe. There is so much to learn from our pets. Everything we love about them is what we miss most in our lives, and that is true friendship—a pair of sincere eyes, a face without a social mask, someone to be here for us when no one else is, someone to understand us and love us unconditionally. We enjoy their company because they help us be who we really are, and they teach us how to enjoy our lives and this world in such a lovely way. Our beloved companions help us find our inner peace, and that’s exactly how we can establish universal peace—by bringing peace into our lives.",N/A,N/A,en
Dogs Never Lie About Love,['Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson'],1998-09-08,['Pets'],"Dogs fill our hearts with love and our minds with wonder, but their emotional lives have remained unexplored since Darwin 125 years ago. Now in Dogs Never Lie About Love, controversial psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson brilliantly navigates the rich inner landscape of ""our best friends."" As he guides readers through the surprising depth of canine emotional complexity, Jeffrey Masson draws from myth and literature, from scientific studies, and from the stories and observations of dog trainers and dog lovers around the world. But the stars of the book are the author's own three dogs whose delightful and mysterious behavior provides the way to exploring a wide range of subjects--from emotions like gratitude, compassion, loneliness, and disappointment to speculating what dogs dream of and how their powerful sense of smell shapes their perception of reality. As he sweeps aside old prejudices on animal behavior, Masson reaches into a rich universe of dog feeling to its essential core, their ""master emotion"": love. Like the dogs he loves, Masson's writing will capture the reader with its playful, mysterious, and serious sides. Its surprising insights provide a new dimension of understanding for dog owners everywhere.",4,N/A,en

Alex & Me,['Irene M. Pepperberg'],2009-03-30,['Science'],"On September 6, 2007, an African Grey parrot named Alex died prematurely at age thirty-one. His last words to his owner, Irene Pepperberg, were ‘You be good. I love you.’ What would normally be a quiet, very private event was, in Alex’s case, headline news. Over the thirty years they had worked together, Alex and Irene had become famous — two pioneers who opened an unprecedented window into the hidden yet vast world of animal minds. When Irene and Alex first met, birds were not believed to possess any potential for language, consciousness, or anything remotely comparable to human intelligence. Yet, over the years, Alex proved many things. He could add. He could sound out words. He understood concepts like bigger, smaller, more, fewer, and none. He was capable of thought and intention. Together, Alex and Irene uncovered a startling reality: We live in a world populated by thinking, conscious creatures. The fame that resulted was extraordinary. Yet there was a side to their relationship that never made the papers. They were emotionally connected to one another. They shared a deep bond far beyond science. Alex missed Irene when she was away. He was jealous when she paid attention to other parrots, or even people. He liked to show her who was boss. He loved to dance. He sometimes became bored by the repetition of his tests, and played jokes on her. Sometimes they sniped at each other. Yet nearly every day, they each said, ‘I love you.’ Alex and Irene stayed together through thick and thin – despite sneers from experts, extraordinary financial sacrifices, and a nomadic existence from one university to another. The story of their thirty-year adventure is a landmark of scientific achievement and of an unforgettable human-animal bond.",N/A,N/A,en

The Invaders,['Pat Shipman'],2015-03-10,['Nature'],"A Times Higher Education Book of the Week Approximately 200,000 years ago, as modern humans began to radiate out from their evolutionary birthplace in Africa, Neanderthals were already thriving in Europe—descendants of a much earlier migration of the African genus Homo. But when modern humans eventually made their way to Europe 45,000 years ago, Neanderthals suddenly vanished. Ever since the first Neanderthal bones were identified in 1856, scientists have been vexed by the question, why did modern humans survive while their closest known relatives went extinct? “Shipman admits that scientists have yet to find genetic evidence that would prove her theory. Time will tell if she’s right. For now, read this book for an engagingly comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving understanding of our own origins.” —Toby Lester, Wall Street Journal “Are humans the ultimate invasive species? So contends anthropologist Pat Shipman—and Neanderthals, she opines, were among our first victims. The relationship between Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis is laid out cleanly, along with genetic and other evidence. Shipman posits provocatively that the deciding factor in the triumph of our ancestors was the domestication of wolves.” —Daniel Cressey, Nature",4,N/A,en
Iris Grace,['Arabella Carter-Johnson'],2017-04-25,['Health & Fitness'],"Iris Grace is a beautiful little girl who, from a very young age, barely communicated, avoided social interaction with other people, and rarely smiled. From both before her diagnosis of autism and after, she seemed trapped in her own world, unable to connect with those around her. One day, her mother brought home a Maine Coon kitten for Iris, even though cats aren’t typically thought of as therapy pets. Thula, named after one of Iris’s favorite African lullabies and meaning “peace” in Zulu, immediately bonded with Iris. Thula knew right away how to assuage Iris when she became overstimulated; when to intervene when Iris became overwhelmed; and how to provide distraction when Iris started heading toward a meltdown. Whether exploring, playing, sleeping, or taking a bath with Iris or accompanying the family on a bike ride, Thula became so much more than a therapy cat. With Thula’s safe companionship, Iris began to talk and interact with her family. This heartwarming story is illustrated with sixty of Iris’s gorgeous impressionistic paintings, works of art that have allowed her to express herself since the age of three. A gifted artist, Iris sees the natural world in a profoundly vivid and visceral way. With Thula by her side, she’ll sit and paint for hours, and the results are stunning. Inspiring and touching, Iris Grace follows the struggles and triumphs of a family—and a miracle cat—as they learn to connect with an amazing child.",N/A,N/A,en

Do Fish Feel Pain?,['Victoria Braithwaite'],2010-03-25,['Sports & Recreation'],"While there has been increasing interest in recent years in the welfare of farm animals, fish are frequently thought to be different. In many people's perception, fish, with their lack of facial expressions or recognisable communication, are not seen to count when it comes to welfare. Angling is a major sport, and fishing a big industry. Millions of fish are caught on barbed hooks, or left to die by suffocation on the decks of fishing boats. Here, biologist Victoria Braithwaite explores the question of fish pain and fish suffering, explaining what we now understand about fish behaviour, and examining the related ethical questions about how we should treat these animals. She asks why the question of pain in fish has not been raised earlier, indicating our prejudices and assumptions; and argues that the latest and growing scientific evidence would suggest that we should widen to fish the protection currently given to birds and mammals.",5,N/A,en

Marley & Me LP,['John Grogan'],2005-10-18,['Pets'],"Is it possible for humans to discover the key to happiness through a bigger-than-life, bad-boy dog? Just ask the Grogans. John and Jenny were just beginning their life together. They were young and in love, with not a care in the world. Then they brought home Marley, a wiggly yellow furball of a puppy. Life would never be the same. Marley grew into a barreling, ninety-seven-pound streamroller of a Labrador retriever. He crashed through screen doors, gouged through drywall, and stole women's undergarments. Obedience school did no good -- Marley was expelled. But just as Marley joyfully refused any limits on his behavior, his love and loyalty were boundless, too. Marley remained a model of devotion, even when his family was at its wit's end. Unconditional love, they would learn, comes in many forms. Marley & Me is John Grogan's funny, unforgettable tribute to this wonderful, wildly neurotic Lab and the meaning he brought to their lives.",N/A,N/A,en

Types and Breeds of Farm Animals (Classic Reprint),['Charles S. Plumb'],2017-10-13,['Pets'],"Excerpt from Types and Breeds of Farm Animals The need for such a volume as this will no doubt be best expressed by a demand for it on the part of live-stock students. The author, however, desires to call attention to the fact that not since 1888 has a volume devoted to the breeds of horses, cattle, sheep, and swine been published in America. The most recent work devoted to the breeds entirely omitted a considera tion of the horse. Further than this but very few books have thus far been published in the English language that have been strictly breed studies. This book differs somewhat from others that have preceded it. A number of breeds have received recognition for the first time, these being the ass, the mule, the angora and milch goats, all animals of importance in certain localities. The more important or better known breeds have received more detailed considera tion than those which may be regarded as the lesser known, and have been so ranked in the make-up of the book. In numerous instances much new historical information has been gathered. During the past twenty years a great amount of evidence bear ing on breed merit has been secured at the agricultural experi ment stations, at expositions, on race courses, and at fair grounds. In the breed reviews in this work much of this recent evidence is given a place. Brief consideration is also given to some of the more important foundation families or tribes, and to individual animals that have made a deep impression upon the breed. The author has taken the liberty of commenting on the weak as well as on the strong points of the breeds, but this has been done in a nonpartisan spirit, in harmony with the views of capable critics.

Afterglow,['Eileen Myles'],2017-09-12,['Pets'],"“A ravishingly strange and gorgeous book about a dog that’s really about life and everything there is…astonishing.” —Helen Macdonald, New York Times-bestselling author of H Is for Hawk In 1990, poet Eileen Myles chose Rosie from a litter of pit bulls on the street, and their connection instantly became central to the writer's life and work. During the course of their sixteen years together, Myles was madly devoted to the dog’s well-being, especially in her final days. Starting from the emptiness following Rosie's death, Afterglow launches a heartfelt and fabulist investigation into the true nature of the bond between pet and pet owner. Through this lens, we witness Myles’s experiences with intimacy and spirituality, celebrity and politics, alcoholism and recovery, fathers and family history, as well as the fantastical myths we spin to get to the heart of grief. Moving from an imaginary talk show where Rosie is interviewed by Myles’s childhood puppet to a critical reenactment of the night Rosie mated with another pit bull, from lyrical transcriptions of their walks to Rosie’s enlightened narration from the afterlife, Afterglow illuminates all that it can mean when we dedicate our existence to a dog. “Myles gets at something no other dog book I’ve read has gotten at quite this distinctly: The sense of wordless connection and spiritual expansion you feel when you love and are loved by a creature who’s not human…raw and affecting.” —Maureen Corrigan, Fresh Air, NPR",N/A,N/A,en

Lad of Sunnybank,['Albert Payson Terhune'],2022-08-16,['Pets'],"In 'Lad of Sunnybank,' Albert Payson Terhune crafts a charming narrative that captures the essence of canine companionship and the joys of rural life. Set in the idyllic backdrop of Sunnybank, the novel chronicles the adventures of a spirited collie named Lad and his bond with the author's family. Terhune's vivid, empathetic prose not only brings to life the vibrant landscapes but also delves into the emotional tapestry of loyalty, love, and the unbreakable connection between humans and dogs. His writing reflects the early 20th-century American pastoral tradition, rich with themes of nature and domesticity while weaving in poignant reflections on the animal-human relationship. Albert Payson Terhune, an American author and dog breeder, drew upon his profound appreciation for the company of canines in creating this beloved tale. His experiences with his own dogs inspired both his literary output and his belief in the nobility of the canine spirit. A prominent member of the literary community in the early 1900s, Terhune's writings frequently explored themes of adventure and loyalty, and his affinity for animals gave him a unique perspective that enriches the narrative in 'Lad of Sunnybank.' This book is a must-read for any animal lover and those who appreciate heartwarming tales of friendship and adventure. Terhune's engaging style and heartfelt storytelling will resonate with readers of all ages, inviting them to reflect on the simple yet profound bonds we share with our pets. 'Lad of Sunnybank' is not only a celebration of dogs but also an enduring reminder of the joy they bring into our lives.",N/A,N/A,en

"Medical, Genetic & Behavioral Risk Factors of Shiba Inus",['Ross D. CLARK DVM'],2014-09-05,['Pets'],"This book (Shiba Inus) provides you with a through description and positive attributes of this breed including origin, purpose, history, normal heights and weights, acceptable colors and behavioral traits. Our books differ from most books on dog breeds because this book also provides you with a comprehensive and authoritative source of all the known predisposed hereditary health syndromes for the breed. You will find extensive references for each problem described. We also provide the breed club address for this breed and a list of laboratories and organizations that can provide professional help and information. As a small animal veterinarian, I have always been intrigued by the way dogs have been bred to fill a purpose in life and further impressed that they also tend to love performing that service. Greyhounds and other sight hounds are built for speed with aerodynamic bodies consisting of small head, deep chest, narrow waist and large leg muscles. On the other hand Dachshunds take their name from German words meaning badger dog and they use their long nose, long body and short legs to both track, enter and dig into badger dens. After developing a practice that catered to clients with show dogs, my interest in each breed continued to grow as I studied and observed more and more about the unique predisposition and incidence of health problems in each breed. Breeders of purebred dogs for show were a challenge and inspirational for me to research and help them with their unique health problems. Historically references to hereditary problems are scattered throughout various Veterinary medical texts and journals such as ophthalmology, neurology, gastroenterology, cardiovascular and dermatology. This book, as well as the other books and articles I have written, is researched and compiled with the intention to provide both veterinarians and dog owners with comprehensive and authoritative predisposition information under the breed name. At the date of this publication, The American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation and the The Kennel Club of England reports over 400 known hereditary health syndromes throughout the dog kingdom. At the writing of my first book in 1983, less than 50 hereditary issues are able to be predicted and or diagnosed. Sequencing of the canine genome, DNA tests, metabolic testing including blood tests and urine testing; plus, phenotypic examinations such as radiographs, ultrasound, and CERF or OFA eye registry exams by a Board Certified Veterinary Ophthalmologist have advanced the science of breed related health and behavioral problems. This book will provide veterinarians, researchers, pet owners and breeders with a comprehensive guide to all the known problems veterinarians and dog owners should consider during pet selection and throughout each life stage of our canine friends.",N/A,N/A,en

The Dogs of the British Islands,['J. H. Walsh'],2018-01-05,['Pets'],"Excerpt from The Dogs of the British Islands: Being a Series of Articles on the Points of Their Various Breeds, and the Treatment of the Disease to Which They Are Subject Ince the third edition of this book was published so Short a time has elapsed that very little change in, or addition to, the Dogs of the British Islands is to be noticed. In the sporting division a warm controversy has for some time been going on with regard to the breeding of the Laverack setter, one party alleging that all of this breed are descended from one pair mentioned by Mr. Laverack as the sole progenitors of his strain, while the other maintain (1st) that Mr. Laverack himself admitted, both orally and in writing, that he had used importations from other kennels; and (2md) that it is incredible that the average age (9) necessary to show the truth of the Adam and Eve theory is within the bounds of possibility. My own Opinion is that the second of these objections is enough to dispose of this theory to the satisfaction of any person of average powers, but that the first is not by any means 'proved. In any case the question is of no importance, for the breed is now to be regarded from actual results, and not from theoretical grounds which ought entirely to give way before our experience of its merits or demerits, whichever may be in excess. Now, on the Show bench, the Laveracks (so called) have held their own both in this country and abroad, but in the field they have stood no chance against the crosses with other strains, and especially with those used by Mr. Purcell Llewellin, whose breed, now called Llewellin's, should therefore be preferred. With this exception there has been little or no novelty in any class of sporting dogs described by me in the previous editions, but I have added an article on the French Basset, now extensively bred in this country, written by Mr. Krehl, which will be read with especial interest by the admirers of that dog, and also by hound men in general.

Illustrated Horse-Breaking,['M. Horace Hayes'],2015-06-05,['Pets'],"Excerpt from Illustrated Horse-Breaking I offer this work to the favourable consideration of the public, as an attempt to describe a reasoned-out system of horse-breaking, which I have found, by practical experience, to be easy of execution, rapid in its effects, and requiring the possession of no exceptional strength, activity, pluck, or horsemanship by the operator, who, to become expert in it, will, as a rule, need only practice. It is in accordance with our English and Irish ideas on the subject; for it aims at teaching the horse ""manners,"" and giving him a snaffle-bridle mouth; so that he will ""go up to the bridle,"" and ""bend"" himself in thorough obedience to rein and leg. As a personal explanation, I may mention that after having spent many years racing and training in India, during which time I practised the ordinary methods of breaking, I returned to England, where I learned the use of the standing martingale and long driving reins, as applied specially to jumpers, from Mr. John Hubert Moore, who was the cleverest ""maker"" of steeplechasers Ireland ever knew. He, I may remark, obtained these methods, in his youth, from an old Irish breaker, named Fallon, who was born more than a century ago. I had also valuable instruction in ""horse-taming"" from Professor Sample. Having read an account of MM. Raabe and Lunel's hppolasso, as a means of control for veterinary operations, I conceived, with happy results, the idea of utilising this ingenious contrivance in breaking. I also learned, about the same time, how to baiter a loose horse without running any danger of being kicked, or bitten. Having thus acquired a fair amount of information, on what has always been to me a favourite subject, I naturally wished to put it into practice. As I knew, judging from my former ignorance, howr much men in India stood in need of instruction in horse-breaking. I determined to return to that country with the object of teaching this art; so as to acquire the experience I needed, and to ""pay my expenses"" at the same time. I am glad to say that I was successful in both respects. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.
