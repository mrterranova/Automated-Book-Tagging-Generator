When All Hell Broke Loose,"['William W. Johnstone', 'J. A. Johnstone']",2022,['Fiction'],"""It's one of the great mysteries of the Old West. The unexplained disappearance of a hunting party of Prussian nobles who entered the American wilderness--and never returned. Now, years later, the Prussian government demands an explanation. In response, the U.S. Army hires Preacher and Jamie MacCallister to join their search party--along with a band of Prussian soldiers led by the sinister Baron Adalwolf von Kuhner. Some believe it's a hopeless mission, that the original party was slaughtered by the Blackfeet. Others think there may be survivors, most likely women held captive as slaves. But it doesn't take Preacher and MacCallister long to learn the horrible truth... This is no rescue mission. It's a massacre in the making. And when the hunters become the hunted, all hell breaks loose.""--",N/A,N/A,en
Hostile Territory,"['William W. Johnstone', 'J. A. Johnstone']",2023,['Fiction'],"""Preacher and Jamie MacCallister search for a hidden fortune that might be just a legend-but the bandits, bullets, and bloodshed they find are all too real . . . Jamie MacCallister remembers the Alamo-especially one brave frontiersman who died fighting there. Now the fallen veteran's granddaughter needs Jamie's help. She's found a letter written by her grandfather with a map to the spot where Alamo legend Jim Bowie supposedly hid a fortune in silver and gold. Jamie never believed the story. Countless treasure hunters had scoured the area and come up empty handed. But his friend's grandaughter is convinced it's hidden where no one has ever dared to search-deep in the heart of Comanche country . . . There's no way Jamie will let this nice young lady venture into such hostile territory-not without his help. But they're going to need backup. Enter Preacher- easily the toughest mountain man in the West and, luckily, Jamie MacCallister's loyal friend. Together, they begin their journey at Fort Belknap, the farthest outpost of civilization-and the gateway to the barbaric Comancheria. In that deadly, untamed land the three will seek their fortune. But what they find is a cutthroat gang of outlaws, a bloodthirsty group of deserters, and a powerful tribe of Comanche warriors-who kill all trespassers on sight.""--",N/A,N/A,en
