Possible Health Hazards from Different Types of Amorphous Silicas,['J. Jahr'],1981,['Amorphous silica'],"A review is given of some of the literature on the effect of different amorphous silicas on the lungs, with emphasis on the type collected in the ferrosilicon industry. Animal experiments indicate that amorphous silica gives a fairly strong initial lung reaction which, however, has little or no tendency to progress, and thus differs significantly from crystalline silica. Most of the reported cases of silicosis among workers exposed to amorphous silica in the ferrosilicon industry have either been transient lung changes or connected to exposure to crystalline silica. Workers exposed only to precipitated amorphous silica do not seem to be at any significant risk. Amorphous silica transforms easily to cristobalite at temperatures much lower than the reported stable temperature range (1470 to 1710°C). It then represents a silicosis hazard if inhaled. Provisional administrative norms (AN) [corresponding to threshold limit values (TLVs)] are suggested.",N/A,N/A

A Review of European Research Into Airtightness and Air Infiltration Measurement Techniques,['MW. Liddament'],1986,['Air infiltration'],"An important function of the Air Infiltration Centre, Bracknell, Berkshire, Great Britain, is to keep research organizations informed of on-going research into air infiltration in buildings. To fulfill this need, the Centre regularly undertakes a worldwide survey of current research. In this report, the results of the Centre's most recent survey, completed in 1983, are used to provide a background to present European airtightness and air infiltration measurement practices. A wide range of research activities are summarized involving the use of both pressurization and tracer gas techniques. In addition, the increasing effort being devoted to the measurement of air infiltration in nondomestic buildings is emphasized.

Les lacunes constitutionnelles,"['Julien Jeanneney', 'Michel Verpeaux']",2016-04-13,[],"Il est fréquent, presque par réflexe, de nier la possibilité de lacunes en présentant les constitutions en général et celle de 1958 en particulier comme étant nécessairement complètes, en ne considérant les lacunes que comme une vue de l’esprit. Cette affirmation méritait d’être évaluée. La thèse mêle, de manière heureuse, l’étude concrète du droit positif et des questionnements de théorie du droit et de théorie constitutionnelle et M Julien Jeanneney passe au crible tant le droit constitutionnel lui-même, institutionnel et jurisprudentiel, que les discours doctrinaux et politiques formulés à son propos. Une fois constatée la richesse des écrits peu connus consacrés, dans de nombreux pays, depuis plus d’un siècle, à la question des lacunes dans les systèmes normatifs, l’auteur a observé que ces propositions de théorie du droit sont rarement évaluées à l’aune d’une analyse précise du droit positif. Il a alors cherché à clarifier les concepts par le truchement desquels est le plus souvent appréhendée la question des lacunes dans les systèmes normatifs, en montrant les avantages et les inconvénients de chacune de ces représentations, à la faveur de leur confrontation avec le droit positif. Il a fait le choix, en particulier, de mettre en regard la diversité des propositions relatives au caractère complet ou lacunaire des systèmes normatifs en général et ce que les systèmes normatifs constitutionnels en particulier la Constitution de 1958 peuvent avoir de singulier. L’auteur défend la thèse selon laquelle les lacunes perçues dans un système normatif sont autant le fruit de la conception systématique des normes juridiques, servie par l’entreprise de dogmatique juridique, que des propriétés attachées, de façon contingente, à tel ou tel système normatif particulier. Constatant le malaise que suscite l’étude des lacunes dans le champ du droit et le désordre conceptuel qui entoure couramment l’utilisation des termes employés pour les désigner, il distingue différents types de lacunes, les lacunes normatives, les « lacunes de reconnaissance «, les «lacunes subjectives», les «lacunes techniques», et les «lacunes axiologiques». A ces différents concepts dont les principaux traits ont été fixés par deux siècles d’écrits doctrinaux, l’auteur propose d’ajouter un concept de «lacune institutionnelle», qui présente, à ses yeux, l’avantage d’illustrer ce qu’il peut y avoir de plus objectif dans la désignation d’une lacune dans la Constitution.",N/A,N/A

A Comparison of Sulfide Stress Cracking Tests,['RS. Treseder'],1990,['Bent beam test'],"Sulfide stress cracking, a form of hydrogen embrittlement, first became a serious problem in the oil industry in 1951. Subsequent improvements in the metallurgy of steels for high-pressure gas and oil wells and improved selection methods for high-strength alloys have been based on laboratory test methods. Of the large number of test methods that have been used, five have survived: the Shell bent beam test, the uniaxial load tension test, the double-cantilever-beam test, the C-ring test, and the slow strain rate test. Major features of these tests are compared in terms of their applicability to specific sulfide stress cracking problems. In addition, a general comparison is made of the testing requirements for the sulfide stress cracking system and for anodic stress corrosion cracking systems involving hydrogen sulfide. These comparisons illustrate the need to design environmental cracking tests which reflect both corrosion mechanism factors and application requirements.",N/A,N/A
Thermal Resistance and Aging of Rigid Urethane Foam Insulation,"['JA. Valenzuela', 'LR. Glicksman']",1983,['Aging'],Relevant data and analyses for aging and effective thermal conductance of rigid urethane and isocyanurate foam are reviewed. Simplified theoretical models are formulated that indicate the order of magnitude and limiting bounds for exact results. Existing heat transfer models underpredict the measured thermal conductance by 25 percent. The discrepancy is most probably caused by thermal radiation transmission through cell walls. Effective diffusion coefficients reported in the literature for different foam samples vary by an order of magnitude. The differences are caused by variations in cell geometry and cell wall permeability.,N/A,N/A

The Origins and Development of Roger J. Williams' Concept of Biochemical Individuality,['Georg-Benedict Brand'],2024-12-30,['History'],"""This book reconstructs and discusses the research of Roger J. Williams and the process of development behind his concept of Biochemical Individuality. As a pioneer within the budding scientific field of biochemistry, Williams explored, collected, and analysed the extent to which human beings differ on a (bio)chemical level, while additionally investigating the effect of this individuality on science, politics, and society. This analysis reconstructs the process of development behind these ideas from inception to conclusion. Chronologically examining all of Williams' publications and personal documents between the years 1919 and 1956 and discussing these within their historical, political, cultural, and scientific contexts, this book investigates the terminology, bibliographical data, and scientific material of these documents in order to illustrate how Williams' theories and ideas morphed over time, while appreciating internal and external influences on this process""--",N/A,N/A

Childhood Factors Related Potentially to Respiratory Health in Adulthood,"['AM. Collier', 'FW. Henderson']",1989,['Air'],"Lower respiratory infections in early childhood, asthma and wheezy syndromes not diagnosed asthma, allergy, airway hyperreactivity, and passive and active tobacco smoke exposure are all related to the level of small airway function measured by spirometry (average expiratory flow rate during the middle half of the exhaled force vital capacity [FEF 25-75] and expiratory flow rate at 50% of the exhaled forced vital capacity [Vmax-50] analyzed most often) in middle childhood. There is a strong tendency for children to maintain their relative levels of spirometric performance through childhood into adolescence and young adulthood (tracking). Therefore, factors that are related to the level of lung function in early to middle childhood are also associated with functional status in late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Since starting level of lung function in early to middle adulthood is related to rate of loss of lung function in later adulthood, childhood factors have the potential for influencing patterns of decline in lung function in adulthood and the risk of developing symptomatic obstructive airway disease in later life.",N/A,N/A
