Handbook of Modern Sensors,['Jacob Fraden'],2015-10-15,['Technology & Engineering'],"This book presents a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the theory (physical principles), design, and practical implementations of various sensors for scientific, industrial, and consumer applications. This latest edition focuses on the sensing technologies driven by the expanding use of sensors in mobile devices. These new miniature sensors will be described, with an emphasis on smart sensors which have embedded processing systems. The chapter on chemical sensors has also been expanded to present the latest developments. Digital systems, however complex and intelligent they may be, must receive information from the outside world that is generally analog and not electrical. Sensors are interface devices between various physical values and the electronic circuits that ""understand"" only a language of moving electrical charges. In other words, sensors are the eyes, ears, and noses of silicon chips. Unlike other books on sensors, the Handbook of Modern Sensors is organized according to the measured variables (temperature, pressure, position, etc.). This book is a reference text for students, researchers interested in modern instrumentation (applied physicists and engineers), sensor designers, application engineers and technicians whose job it is to understand, select and/or design sensors for practical systems.",N/A,N/A,en

Control of Machines with Friction,['Brian Armstrong-Hélouvry'],2012-12-06,['Technology & Engineering'],"It is my ambition in writing this book to bring tribology to the study of control of machines with friction. Tribology, from the greek for study of rubbing, is the discipline that concerns itself with friction, wear and lubrication. Tribology spans a great range of disciplines, from surface physics to lubrication chemistry and engineering, and comprises investigators in diverse specialities. The English language tribology literature now grows at a rate of some 700 articles per year. But for all of this activity, in the three years that I have been concerned with the control of machines with friction, I have but once met a fellow controls engineer who was aware that the field existed, this including many who were concerned with friction. In this vein I must confess that, before undertaking these investigations, I too was unaware that an active discipline of friction existed. The experience stands out as a mark of the specialization of our time. Within tribology, experimental and theoretical understanding of friction in lubricated machines is well developed. The controls engineer's interest is in dynamics, which is not the central interest of the tribologist. The tribologist is more often concerned with wear, with respect to which there has been enormous progress - witness the many mechanisms which we buy today that are lubricated once only, and that at the factory. Though a secondary interest, frictional dynamics are note forgotten by tribology.",N/A,N/A,en

Fundamentals of Agricultural and Field Robotics,"['Manoj Karkee', 'Qin Zhang']",2021-07-27,['Technology & Engineering'],"Over the past century, mechanization has been an important means for optimizing resource utilization, improving worker health and safety and reducing labor requirements in farming while increasing productivity and quality of 4F (Food, Fuel, Fiber, Feed). Recognizing this contribution, agricultural mechanization was considered as one of the top ten engineering achievements of 20th century by the National Academy of Engineering. Accordingly farming communities have adopted increasing level of automation and robotics to further improve the precision management of crops (including input resources), increase productivity and reduce farm labor beyond what has been possible with conventional mechanization technologies. It is more important than ever to continue to develop and adopt novel automation and robotic solutions into farming so that some of the most complex agricultural tasks, which require huge amount of seasonal labor such as fruit and vegetable harvesting, could be automated while meeting the rapidly increasing need for 4F. In addition, continual innovation in and adoption of agricultural automation and robotic technologies is essential to minimize the use of depleting resources including water, minerals and other chemicals so that sufficient amount of safe and healthy food can be produced for current generation while not compromising the potential for the future generation. This book aims at presenting the fundamental principles of various aspects of automation and robotics as they relate to production agriculture (the branch of agriculture dealing with farming operations from field preparation to seeding, to harvesting and field logistics). The building blocks of agricultural automation and robotics that are discussed in the book include sensing and machine vision, control, guidance, manipulation and end-effector technologies. The fundamentals and operating principles of these technologies are explained with examples from cutting-edge research and development currently going on around the word. This book brings together scientists, engineers, students and professionals working in these and related technologies to present their latest examples of agricultural automation and robotics research, innovation and development while explaining the fundamentals of the technology. The book, therefore, benefits those who wish to develop novel agricultural engineering solutions and/or to adopt them in the future.",N/A,N/A,en

Elements of Robotics,"['Mordechai Ben-Ari', 'Francesco Mondada']",2017-10-25,['Computers'],"This open access book bridges the gap between playing with robots in school and studying robotics at the upper undergraduate and graduate levels to prepare for careers in industry and research. Robotic algorithms are presented formally, but using only mathematics known by high-school and first-year college students, such as calculus, matrices and probability. Concepts and algorithms are explained through detailed diagrams and calculations. Elements of Robotics presents an overview of different types of robots and the components used to build robots, but focuses on robotic algorithms: simple algorithms like odometry and feedback control, as well as algorithms for advanced topics like localization, mapping, image processing, machine learning and swarm robotics. These algorithms are demonstrated in simplified contexts that enable detailed computations to be performed and feasible activities to be posed. Students who study these simplified demonstrations will be well prepared for advanced study of robotics. The algorithms are presented at a relatively abstract level, not tied to any specific robot. Instead a generic robot is defined that uses elements common to most educational robots: differential drive with two motors, proximity sensors and some method of displaying output to the user. The theory is supplemented with over 100 activities, most of which can be successfully implemented using inexpensive educational robots. Activities that require more computation can be programmed on a computer. Archives are available with suggested implementations for the Thymio robot and standalone programs in Python.",N/A,N/A,en

Microcontrollers Fundamentals for Engineers and Scientists,"['Steven F. Barrett', 'Daniel J. Pack']",2022-06-01,['Technology & Engineering'],"This book provides practicing scientists and engineers a tutorial on the fundamental concepts and use of microcontrollers. Today, microcontrollers, or single integrated circuit (chip) computers, play critical roles in almost all instrumentation and control systems. Most existing books arewritten for undergraduate and graduate students taking an electrical and/or computer engineering course. Furthermore, these texts have beenwritten with a particular model of microcontroller as the target discussion. These textbooks also require a requisite knowledge of digital design fundamentals. This textbook presents the fundamental concepts common to all microcontrollers. Our goals are to present the over–arching theory of microcontroller operation and to provide a detailed discussion on constituent subsystems available in most microcontrollers. With such goals, we envision that the theory discussed in this book can be readily applied to a wide variety of microcontroller technologies, allowing practicing scientists and engineers to become acquainted with basic concepts prior to beginning a design involving a specific microcontroller. We have found that the fundamental principles of a given microcontroller are easily transferred to other controllers.

Reservoir Computing,"['Kohei Nakajima', 'Ingo Fischer']",2021-08-05,['Computers'],"This book is the first comprehensive book about reservoir computing (RC). RC is a powerful and broadly applicable computational framework based on recurrent neural networks. Its advantages lie in small training data set requirements, fast training, inherent memory and high flexibility for various hardware implementations. It originated from computational neuroscience and machine learning but has, in recent years, spread dramatically, and has been introduced into a wide variety of fields, including complex systems science, physics, material science, biological science, quantum machine learning, optical communication systems, and robotics. Reviewing the current state of the art and providing a concise guide to the field, this book introduces readers to its basic concepts, theory, techniques, physical implementations and applications. The book is sub-structured into two major parts: theory and physical implementations. Both parts consist of a compilation of chapters, authored by leading experts in their respective fields. The first part is devoted to theoretical developments of RC, extending the framework from the conventional recurrent neural network context to a more general dynamical systems context. With this broadened perspective, RC is not restricted to the area of machine learning but is being connected to a much wider class of systems. The second part of the book focuses on the utilization of physical dynamical systems as reservoirs, a framework referred to as physical reservoir computing. A variety of physical systems and substrates have already been suggested and used for the implementation of reservoir computing. Among these physical systems which cover a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, are mechanical and optical systems, nanomaterials, spintronics, and quantum many body systems.

Computer Intensive Methods in Control and Signal Processing,"['Kevin Warwick', 'Miroslav Karny']",2012-12-06,['Technology & Engineering'],"Due to the rapid increase in readily available computing power, a corre sponding increase in the complexity of problems being tackled has occurred in the field of systems as a whole. A plethora of new methods which can be used on the problems has also arisen with a constant desire to deal with more and more difficult applications. Unfortunately by increasing the ac curacy in models employed along with the use of appropriate algorithms with related features, the resultant necessary computations can often be of very high dimension. This brings with it a whole new breed of problem which has come to be known as ""The Curse of Dimensionality"" . The expression ""Curse of Dimensionality"" can be in fact traced back to Richard Bellman in the 1960's. However, it is only in the last few years that it has taken on a widespread practical significance although the term di mensionality does not have a unique precise meaning and is being used in a slightly different way in the context of algorithmic and stochastic complex ity theory or in every day engineering. In principle the dimensionality of a problem depends on three factors: on the engineering system (subject), on the concrete task to be solved and on the available resources. A system is of high dimension if it contains a lot of elements/variables and/or the rela tionship/connection between the elements/variables is complicated.",N/A,N/A,en

Advanced Electrical Drives,"['Rik W. De Doncker', 'Duco W.J. Pulle', 'André Veltman']",2020-08-21,['Technology & Engineering'],"This book provides a unique approach to derive model-based torque controllers for all types of Lorentz force machines, i.e. DC, synchronous and induction machines. The rotating transformer model forms the basis for the generalized modeling approach of rotating field machines, which leads to the development of universal field-oriented control algorithms. Contrary to this, direct torque control algorithms, using observer-based methods, are developed for switched reluctance machines. Tutorials are included at the end of each chapter, and the reader is encouraged to execute these tutorials in order to gain familiarity with the dynamic behavior of drive systems. This updated edition uses PLECS® simulation and vector processing tools that were specifically adopted for the purpose of these hands-on tutorials. Hence, Advanced Electrical Drives encourages “learning by doing” and the experienced drive specialist may find the simulation tools useful to design high-performance torque controllers. Although it is a powerful reference in its own right, when used in conjunction with the companion texts Fundamentals of Electrical Drives and Applied Control of Electrical Drives, this book provides a uniquely comprehensive reference set that takes readers all the way from understanding the basics of how electrical drives work, to deep familiarity with advanced features and models, to a mastery of applying the concepts to actual hardware in practice. Teaches readers to perform insightful analysis of AC electrical machines and drives; Introduces new modeling methods and modern control techniques for switched reluctance drives; Updated to use PLECS® simulation tools for modeling electrical drives, including new and more experimental results; Numerous tutorials at end of each chapter to learn by doing, step-by-step; Includes extra material featuring “build and play” lab modules, for lectures and self-study.",N/A,N/A,en

Cambrian Intelligence,['Rodney Allen Brooks'],1999,['Computers'],"Until the mid-1980s, AI researchers assumed that an intelligent system doing high-level reasoning was necessary for the coupling of perception and action. In this traditional model, cognition mediates between perception and plans of action. Realizing that this core AI, as it was known, was illusory, Rodney A. Brooks turned the field of AI on its head by introducing the behavior-based approach to robotics. The cornerstone of behavior-based robotics is the realization that the coupling of perception and action gives rise to all the power of intelligence and that cognition is only in the eye of an observer. Behavior-based robotics has been the basis of successful applications in entertainment, service industries, agriculture, mining, and the home. It has given rise to both autonomous mobile robots and more recent humanoid robots such as Brooks' Cog. This book represents Brooks' initial formulation of and contributions to the development of the behavior-based approach to robotics.

Theory of Automatic Robot Assembly and Programming,['Bartholomew O. Nnaji'],1993,['Computers'],Machines will gradually become programmed using computers which have the knowledge of how the objects in the world relate to one another. This book capitalizes on the fact that products which are manufactured can be designed on the computer and that information about the product such as its physical shape provide powerful information to reason about how to develop the process plan for their manufacture. This book explores the whole aspect of using the principles of how parts behave naturally to automatically generate programs that govern how to produce them. The last decade saw tremendous work on how machines can be programmed to perform a variety of tasks automatically. Robotics has witnessed the most work on programming techniques. But it was not until the emergence of the advanced CAD system as a proper source of information representation about objects which are to be manipulated by the robot that it became viable for automated processors to generate robot programs without human interface. It became possible for objects to be described and for principles about how they interact in the world to be developed. The functions which the features designed into the objects serve for the objects can be adequately represented and used in reasoning about the manufacturing of the parts using the robot. This book describes the necessary principles which must be developed for a robot to generate its own programs with the knowledge of the world in the CAD system.,N/A,N/A,en

This is the study of the reconstruction of 3-D models of objects from a collection of 2-D images. An essential prerequisite for this book is a course in linear algebra at the advanced undergraduate level. Background knowledge in rigid-body motion, estimation and optimization will certainly improve the reader's appreciation of the material but is not critical since the first few chapters and the appendices provide a review and summary of basic notions and results on these topics.

"Robotics, Vision and Control",['Peter Corke'],2011-09-05,['Technology & Engineering'],"The author has maintained two open-source MATLAB Toolboxes for more than 10 years: one for robotics and one for vision. The key strength of the Toolboxes provide a set of tools that allow the user to work with real problems, not trivial examples. For the student the book makes the algorithms accessible, the Toolbox code can be read to gain understanding, and the examples illustrate how it can be used —instant gratification in just a couple of lines of MATLAB code. The code can also be the starting point for new work, for researchers or students, by writing programs based on Toolbox functions, or modifying the Toolbox code itself. The purpose of this book is to expand on the tutorial material provided with the toolboxes, add many more examples, and to weave this into a narrative that covers robotics and computer vision separately and together. The author shows how complex problems can be decomposed and solved using just a few simple lines of code, and hopefully to inspire up and coming researchers. The topics covered are guided by the real problems observed over many years as a practitioner of both robotics and computer vision. It is written in a light but informative style, it is easy to read and absorb, and includes a lot of Matlab examples and figures.

It is, in fact, the quest for counteracting its dreaded conse quences that are bound to follow, which half a century ago provided the stimulus for launching the space program. Coal and oil are made out of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Hydrocarbon molecules consisting of these atoms are the essential ingredients of life by providing energy in a remarkably compact from. This property is due to the fact that hydrocarbons, by themselves, are not highly energetic materi als. The energy is derived from them by chemical reaction with oxygen supplied by the surrounding air. This reaction provides heat and is referred to for that reason as exothermic. The mass of oxidizer it requires is, in fact, ~ 3. 5 (if it is provided by oxygen alone) or ~ 15 (if it is supplied by air) times larger than that of the hydrocarbon.

Robot Sex,"['John Danaher', 'Neil McArthur']",2017-10-13,['Computers'],"Perspectives from philosophy, psychology religious studies, economics, and law on the possible future of robot-human sexual relationships. Sexbots are coming. Given the pace of technological advances, it is inevitable that realistic robots specifically designed for people's sexual gratification will be developed in the not-too-distant future. Despite popular culture's fascination with the topic, and the emergence of the much-publicized Campaign Against Sex Robots, there has been little academic research on the social, philosophical, moral, and legal implications of robot sex. This book fills the gap, offering perspectives from philosophy, psychology, religious studies, economics, and law on the possible future of robot-human sexual relationships. Contributors discuss what a sex robot is, if they exist, why we should take the issue seriously, and what it means to “have sex” with a robot. They make the case for developing sex robots, arguing for their beneficial nature, and the case against it, on religious and moral grounds; they consider the subject from the robot's perspective, addressing such issues as consent and agency; and they ask whether it is possible for a human to form a mutually satisfying, loving relationship with a robot. Finally, they speculate about the future of human-robot sexual interaction, considering the social acceptability of sex robots and the possible effect on society.

Fundamentals of Robotic Mechanical Systems,['Jorge Angeles'],2007-09-04,['Technology & Engineering'],"Modern robotics dates from the late 1960s, when progress in the development of microprocessors made possible the computer control of a multiaxial manipulator. Since then, robotics has evolved to connect with many branches of science and engineering, and to encompass such diverse fields as computer vision, artificial intelligence, and speech recognition. This book deals with robots - such as remote manipulators, multifingered hands, walking machines, flight simulators, and machine tools - that rely on mechanical systems to perform their tasks. It aims to establish the foundations on which the design, control and implementation of the underlying mechanical systems are based. The treatment assumes familiarity with some calculus, linear algebra, and elementary mechanics; however, the elements of rigid-body mechanics and of linear transformations are reviewed in the first chapters, making the presentation self-contained. An extensive set of exercises is included. Topics covered include: kinematics and dynamics of serial manipulators with decoupled architectures; trajectory planning; determination of the angular velocity and angular acceleration of a rigid body from point data; inverse and direct kinematics manipulators; dynamics of general parallel manipulators of the platform type; and the kinematics and dynamics of rolling robots. Since the publication of the previous edition there have been numerous advances in both the applications of robotics (including in laprascopy, haptics, manufacturing, and most notably space exploration) as well as in the theoretical aspects (for example, the proof that Husty's 40th-degree polynomial is indeed minimal - mentioned as an open question in the previous edition).",N/A,N/A,en

Deep Thinking,['Garry Kasparov'],2017-05-16,[],"In May 1997, the world watched as Garry Kasparov, the greatest chess player in the world, was defeated for the first time by the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. It was a watershed moment in the history of technology: machine intelligence had arrived at the point where it could best human intellect. It wasn't a coincidence that Kasparov became the symbol of man's fight against the machines. Chess has long been the fulcrum in development of machine intelligence; the hoax automaton 'The Turk' in the 18th century and Alan Turing's first chess program in 1952 were two early examples of the quest for machines to think like humans - a talent we measured by their ability to beat their creators at chess. As the pre-eminent chessmaster of the 80s and 90s, it was Kasparov's blessing and his curse to play against each generation's strongest computer champions, contributing to their development and advancing the field. Like all passionate competitors, Kasparov has taken his defeat and learned from it. He has devoted much energy to devising ways in which humans can partner with machines in order to produce results better than either can achieve alone. During the twenty years since playing Deep Blue, he's played both with and against machines, learning a great deal about our vital relationship with our most remarkable creations. Ultimately, he's become convinced that by embracing the competition between human and machine intelligence, we can spend less time worrying about being replaced and more thinking of new challenges to conquer. In this breakthrough book, Kasparov tells his side of the story of Deep Blue for the first time - what it was like to strategize against an implacable, untiring opponent - the mistakes he made and the reasons the odds were against him. But more than that, he tells his story of AI more generally, and how he's evolved to embrace it, taking part in an urgent debate with philosophers worried about human values, programmers creating self-learning neural networks, and engineers of cutting edge robotics.",N/A,N/A,en

Engelberger'],1983-06-30,['Technology & Engineering'],"THE REAL THING by Isaac Asimov Back in 1939, when I was still a teenager, I began to write (and publish) a series of stories about robots which, for the first time in science fiction, were pictured as having been deliberately engineered to do their job safely. They were not intended to be creaky Gothic menaces, nor outlets for mawkish sentiment. They were simply well-designed machines. Beginning in 1942, I crystallized this notion in what I called 'The Three Laws of Robotics' and, in 1950, nine of my robot stories were collected into a book, I, Robot. I did not at that time seriously believe that I would live to see robots in action and robotics becoming a booming industry .... Yet here we are, better yet, I am alive to see it. But then, why shouldn't they be with us? Robots fulfil an important role in industry. They do simple and repetitive jobs more steadily, more reliably, and more uncomplainingly than a human being could - or should. Does a robot displace a human being? Certainly, but he does so at a job that, simply because a robot can do it, is beneath the dignity of a human being; a job that is no more than mindless drudgery. Better and more human jobs can be found for human beings - and should.",N/A,N/A,en

Asynchronous Sequential Machine Design and Analysis,['Richard Tinder'],2022-06-01,['Technology & Engineering'],"Asynchronous Sequential Machine Design and Analysis provides a lucid, in-depth treatment of asynchronous state machine design and analysis presented in two parts: Part I on the background fundamentals related to asynchronous sequential logic circuits generally, and Part II on self-timed systems, high-performance asynchronous programmable sequencers, and arbiters. Part I provides a detailed review of the background fundamentals for the design and analysis of asynchronous finite state machines (FSMs). Included are the basic models, use of fully documented state diagrams, and the design and characteristics of basic memory cells and Muller C-elements. Simple FSMs using C-elements illustrate the design process. The detection and elimination of timing defects in asynchronous FSMs are covered in detail. This is followed by the array algebraic approach to the design of single-transition-time machines and use of CAD software for that purpose, one-hot asynchronous FSMs, and pulse mode FSMs. Part I concludes with the analysis procedures for asynchronous state machines. Part II is concerned mainly with self-timed systems, programmable sequencers, and arbiters. It begins with a detailed treatment of externally asynchronous/internally clocked (or pausable) systems that are delay-insensitive and metastability-hardened. This is followed by defect-free cascadable asynchronous sequencers, and defect-free one-hot asynchronous programmable sequencers--their characteristics, design, and applications. Part II concludes with arbiter modules of various types, those with and without metastability protection, together with applications. Presented in the appendices are brief reviews covering mixed-logic gate symbology, Boolean algebra, and entered-variable K-map minimization. End-of-chapter problems and a glossary of terms, expressions, and abbreviations contribute to the reader's learning experience.

IEC 61131–3: Programming Industrial Automation Systems,"['Karl-Heinz John', 'Michael Tiegelkamp']",2013-06-29,['Computers'],"The programming of industrial controllers has developed into a fully-fledged engineering discipline in its own right over the last few years. It soon became apparent that the concepts and languages used in office automation were not equal to the task. ""Rugged software"" and fast adaptability are just two examples of the additional demands made by industrial automation technology. To standardise a variety of modern concepts and languages for the benefit of users, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed a standard for using industrial controllers. Based on experience with cxisting PLC languages, five programming languages were defined, together with a data concept using modern software development methods. This book introduces these new programming concepts, assesses the value of the standard in the industrial context, and provides achecklist to enable users to appraise the functionality of a programming system. It also includes two free programming packages on CD-ROM, inviting the reader to try out IEC 61131 programming.

Geometric Design of Linkages,"['J. Michael McCarthy', 'Gim Song Soh']",2010-11-11,['Science'],"This book is an introduction to the mathematical theory of design for articulated mechanical systems known as linkages. The focus is on sizing mechanical constraints that guide the movement of a work piece, or end-effector, of the system. The function of the device is prescribed as a set of positions to be reachable by the end-effector; and the mechanical constraints are formed by joints that limit relative movement. The goal is to find all the devices that can achieve a specific task. Formulated in this way the design problem is purely geometric in character. Robot manipulators, walking machines, and mechanical hands are examples of articulated mechanical systems that rely on simple mechanical constraints to provide a complex workspace for the end- effector. The principles presented in this book form the foundation for a design theory for these devices. The emphasis, however, is on articulated systems with fewer degrees of freedom than that of the typical robotic system, and therefore, less complexity. This book will be useful to mathematics, engineering and computer science departments teaching courses on mathematical modeling of robotics and other articulated mechanical systems. This new edition includes research results of the past decade on the synthesis of multi loop planar and spherical linkages, and the use of homotopy methods and Clifford algebras in the synthesis of spatial serial chains. One new chapter on the synthesis of spatial serial chains introduces numerical homotopy and the linear product decomposition of polynomial systems. The second new chapter introduces the Clifford algebra formulation of the kinematics equations of serial chain robots. Examples are use throughout to demonstrate the theory.",N/A,N/A,en

Haptics Technologies,"['Abdulmotaleb El Saddik', 'Mauricio Orozco', 'Mohamad Eid', 'Jongeun Cha']",2011-09-15,['Computers'],"The term “haptics” refers to the science of sensing and manipulation through touch. Multiple disciplines such as biomechanics, psychophysics, robotics, neuroscience, and software engineering converge to support haptics, and generally, haptic research is done by three communities: the robotics community, the human computer interface community, and the virtual reality community. This book is different from any other book that has looked at haptics. The authors treat haptics as a new medium rather than just a domain within one of the above areas. They describe human haptic perception and interfaces and present fundamentals in haptic rendering and modeling in virtual environments. Diverse software architectures for standalone and networked haptic systems are explained, and the authors demonstrate the vast application spectrum of this emerging technology along with its accompanying trends. The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive overview and a practical understanding of haptic technologies. An appreciation of the close relationship between the wide range of disciplines that constitute a haptic system is a key principle towards being able to build successful collaborative haptic environments. Structured as a reference to allow for fast accommodation of the issues concerned, this book is intended for researchers interested in studying touch and force feedback for use in technological multimedia systems in computer science, electrical engineering, or other related disciplines.

Centauri Dreams,['Paul Gilster'],2013-04-18,['Science'],"I wrote this book because I wanted to learn more about interstel lar flight. Not the Star Trek notion of tearing around the Galaxy in a huge spaceship-that was obviously beyond existing tech nology-but a more realistic mission. In 1989 I had videotaped Voyager 2's encounter with Neptune and watched the drama of robotic exploration over and over again. I started to wonder whether we could do something similar with Alpha Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun. Everyone seemed to agree that manned flight to the stars was out of the question, if not permanently then for the indefinitely foreseeable future. But surely we could do something with robotics. And if we could figure out a theoretical way to do it, how far were we from the actual technology that would make it happen? In other words, what was the state of our interstellar technology today, those concepts and systems that might translate into a Voyager to the stars? Finding answers meant talking to people inside and outside of NASA. I was surprised to learn that there is a large literature of interstellar flight. Nobody knows for sure how to propel a space craft fast enough to make the interstellar crossing within a time scale that would fit the conventional idea of a mission, but there are candidate systems that are under active investigation.

Far from railing against a future in which machines rule the world, Moravec embraces it, taking the startling view that intelligent robots will actually be our evolutionary heirs. ""Intelligent machines, which will grow from us, learn our skills, and share our goals and values, can be viewed as children of our minds."" And since they are our children, we will want them to outdistance us. In fact, in a bid for immortality, many of our descendants will choose to transform into ""ex humans,"" as they upload themselves into advanced computers.

Robot Motion Planning,['Jean-Claude Latombe'],2012-12-06,['Technology & Engineering'],"One of the ultimate goals in Robotics is to create autonomous robots. Such robots will accept high-level descriptions of tasks and will execute them without further human intervention. The input descriptions will specify what the user wants done rather than how to do it. The robots will be any kind of versatile mechanical device equipped with actuators and sensors under the control of a computing system. Making progress toward autonomous robots is of major practical inter est in a wide variety of application domains including manufacturing, construction, waste management, space exploration, undersea work, as sistance for the disabled, and medical surgery. It is also of great technical interest, especially for Computer Science, because it raises challenging and rich computational issues from which new concepts of broad useful ness are likely to emerge. Developing the technologies necessary for autonomous robots is a formidable undertaking with deep interweaved ramifications in auto mated reasoning, perception and control. It raises many important prob lems. One of them - motion planning - is the central theme of this book. It can be loosely stated as follows: How can a robot decide what motions to perform in order to achieve goal arrangements of physical objects? This capability is eminently necessary since, by definition, a robot accomplishes tasks by moving in the real world.

Robust Power System Frequency Control,['Hassan Bevrani'],2008-12-19,['Technology & Engineering'],"Frequency control as a major function of automatic generation control is one of the important control problems in electric power system design and operation, and is becoming more signi?cant today because of the increasing size, changing structure, emerging new uncertainties, environmental constraints and the complexity of power systems. In the last two decades, many studies have focused on damping control and vo- age stability and the related issues, but there has been much less work on the power system frequency control analysis and synthesis. While some aspects of frequency control have been illustrated along with individual chapters, many conferences and technical papers, a comprehensive and sensible practical explanation of robust f- quency control in a book form is necessary. This book provides a thorough understanding of the basic principles of power system frequency behaviour in wide range of operating conditions. It uses simple frequency response models, control structures andmathematical algorithms to adapt modern robust control theorems with frequency control issue and conceptual exp- nations. Most developed control strategies are examined by real-time simulations. Practical methods for computer analysis and design are emphasized. This book emphasizes the physical and engineering aspects of the power s- tem frequency control design problem, providing a conceptual understanding of frequency regulation, and application of robust control techniques. The main aim is to develop an appropriate intuition relative to the robust load frequency regulation problem in real-world power systems, rather than to describe sophisticated mat- matical analytical methods.",N/A,N/A,en

Ethics and Robotics,"['Rafael Capurro', 'Michael Nagenborg']",2009,['Robotics'],"""Ethics and robotics are two academic disciplines, one dealing with the moral norms and values underlying implicitly or explicitly human behavior and the other aiming at the production of artificial agents, mostly as physical devices, with some degree of autonomy based on rules and programmes set up by their creators. Robotics is also one of the research fields where the convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science is currently taking place with large societal and legal implications beyond traditional industrial applications. Robots are and will remain -in the foreseeable future- dependent on human ethical scrutiny as well as on the moral and legal responsibility of humans. Human-robot interaction raises serious ethical questions right now that are theoretically less ambitious, but practically more important than the possibility of the creation of moral machines that would be more than machines with an ethical code. The ethical perspective addressed in this volume is therefore the one we humans have when interacting with robots. Topics include the ethical challenges of healthcare and warfare applications of robotics, as well as fundamental questions concerning the moral dimension of human-robot-interaction including epistomological, ontological and psychoanalytic issues. It deals also with the intercultural dialogue between Western and Non-Western as well as between European and US-American ethicists.""--P. [4] of cover.",N/A,N/A,en

Sliding Modes in Control and Optimization,['Vadim I. Utkin'],2013-03-12,['Technology & Engineering'],"The book is devoted to systems with discontinuous control. The study of discontinuous dynamic systems is a multifacet problem which embraces mathematical, control theoretic and application aspects. Times and again, this problem has been approached by mathematicians, physicists and engineers, each profession treating it from its own positions. Interestingly, the results obtained by specialists in different disciplines have almost always had a significant effect upon the development of the control theory. It suffices to mention works on the theory of oscillations of discontinuous nonlinear systems, mathematical studies in ordinary differential equations with discontinuous righthand parts or variational problems in nonclassic statements. The unremitting interest to discontinuous control systems enhanced by their effective application to solution of problems most diverse in their physical nature and functional purpose is, in the author's opinion, a cogent argument in favour of the importance of this area of studies. It seems a useful effort to consider, from a control theoretic viewpoint, the mathematical and application aspects of the theory of discontinuous dynamic systems and determine their place within the scope of the present-day control theory. The first attempt was made by the author in 1975-1976 in his course on ""The Theory of Discontinuous Dynamic Systems"" and ""The Theory of Variable Structure Systems"" read to post-graduates at the University of Illinois, USA, and then presented in 1978-1979 at the seminars held in the Laboratory of Systems with Discontinous Control at the Institute of Control Sciences in Moscow.",N/A,N/A,en

The Coming Robot Revolution,"['Yoseph Bar-Cohen', 'David Hanson']",2009-04-20,['Technology & Engineering'],"Making a robot that looks and behaves like a human being has been the subject of many popular science fiction movies and books. Although the development of such a robot facesmanychallenges,themakingofavirtualhumanhaslongbeenpotentiallypossible. With recent advances in various key technologies related to hardware and software, the making of humanlike robots is increasingly becoming an engineering reality. Development of the required hardware that can perform humanlike functions in a lifelike manner has benefitted greatly from development in such technologies as biologically inspired materials, artificial intelligence, artificial vision, and many others. Producing a humanlike robot that makes body and facial expressions, communicates verbally using extensive vocabulary, and interprets speech with high accuracy is ext- mely complicated to engineer. Advances in voice recognition and speech synthesis are increasingly improving communication capabilities. In our daily life we encounter such innovations when we call the telephone operators of most companies today. As robotics technology continues to improve we are approaching the point where, on seeing such a robot, we will respond with ‘‘Wow, this robot looks unbelievably real!’’ just like the reaction to an artificial flower. The accelerating pace of advances in related fields suggests that the emergence of humanlike robots that become part of our daily life seems to be imminent. These robots are expected to raise ethical concerns and may also raise many complex questions related to their interaction with humans.",N/A,N/A,en

Unmanned Aircraft Design,['Mohammad H. Sadraey'],2024-09-07,['Technology & Engineering'],"This book provides fundamental principles, design procedures, and design tools for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with three sections focusing on vehicle design, autopilot design, and ground system design. The design of manned aircraft and the design of UAVs have some similarities and some differences. They include the design process, constraints (e.g., g-load, pressurization), and UAV main components (autopilot, ground station, communications system, sensors, and payload). A UAV designer must be aware of the latest UAV developments; current technologies; know lessons learned from past failures; and they should appreciate the breadth of UAV design options. The contribution of unmanned aircraft continues to expand every day and over 67 countries are developing and employing UAVs for both military and civil/scientific purposes. A UAV system is much more than a reusable air vehicle or vehicles. UAVs are air vehicles, they fly like airplanes and operate in an airplane environment. They are designed like air vehicles; they have to meet critical air vehicle requirements. A designer needs to know how to integrate complex, multi-disciplinary systems, and to understand the environment, the requirements and the design challenges and this book is an excellent overview of the fundamentals from an engineering perspective. This book is meant to meet the needs of newcomers into the world of UAVs. The materials are intended to provide enough information in each area and illustrate how they all play together to support the design of a complete UAV. Therefore, this book can be used both as a reference for engineers entering the field or as a supplementary text for a UAV design course to provide system-level context for each specialized topic. The second edition is extensively revised. Some of the new terminologies, concepts, and specific unmanned aircraft systems are introduced. The revisions make the book clearer and easier to understand, and will add number of new subjects in areas that have become more prominent in the unmanned aviation world.",N/A,N/A,en
Pneumatic Drives,['Peter Beater'],2007-02-23,['Technology & Engineering'],"The idea to use air for transmitting power is very old. Ctesibius in - cient Greece described a catapult using pneumatic cylinders to first store energy and then rapidly accelerate an arrow. Heron of Alexandria dev- oped automatic temple doors which opened and closed by means of hot air. And from the Greek word for breath he coined the term that was used as title for his book and today describes a whole industry: - pneumatics. Pneumatic components and systems have become an important topic for textbooks. Most have their focus on the description of the steady-state - haviour, practical problems like troubleshooting or Boolean algebra to help designing control algorithms. Only a few textbooks covering the theore- cal analysis and design of pneumatic systems have been published (Z- manzon et al. 1965; Andersen 1967; Andersson et al. 1975). But they were written at a time when digital computers were not easily available to en- neers and therefore contain few material about modelling and simulation. This book tries to bridge the gap between scientific disciplines (fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, mathematics, control, etc.), the conventional approach to describe pneumatic components and systems by their stea- state behaviour, the wish of a design engineer to test his design before - tually building hardware and the resulting need for mathematical models in order to use today’s powerful digital computers.",N/A,N/A,en

Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability,"['Sean P. Meyn', 'Richard L. Tweedie']",2012-12-06,['Technology & Engineering'],"Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability is part of the Communications and Control Engineering Series (CCES) edited by Professors B.W. Dickinson, E.D. Sontag, M. Thoma, A. Fettweis, J.L. Massey and J.W. Modestino. The area of Markov chain theory and application has matured over the past 20 years into something more accessible and complete. It is of increasing interest and importance. This publication deals with the action of Markov chains on general state spaces. It discusses the theories and the use to be gained, concentrating on the areas of engineering, operations research and control theory. Throughout, the theme of stochastic stability and the search for practical methods of verifying such stability, provide a new and powerful technique. This does not only affect applications but also the development of the theory itself. The impact of the theory on specific models is discussed in detail, in order to provide examples as well as to demonstrate the importance of these models. Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability can be used as a textbook on applied Markov chain theory, provided that one concentrates on the main aspects only. It is also of benefit to graduate students with a standard background in countable space stochastic models. Finally, the book can serve as a research resource and active tool for practitioners.",N/A,N/A,en

Artificial Intelligence,['Rainer Born'],2019-12,['Artificial intelligence'],"The purpose of this book, originally published in 1987, was to contribute to the advance of artificial intelligence (AI) by clarifying and removing the major sources of philosophical confusion at the time which continued to preoccupy scientists and thereby impede research. Unlike the vast majority of philosophical critiques of AI, however, each of the authors in this volume has made a serious attempt to come to terms with the scientific theories that have been developed, rather than attacking superficial 'straw men' which bear scant resemblance to the complex theories that have been developed. For each is convinced that the philosopher's responsibility is to contribute from his own special intellectual point of view to the progress of such an important field, rather than sitting in lofty judgement dismissing the efforts of their scientific peers. The aim of this book is thus to correct some of the common misunderstandings of its subject. The technical term Artificial Intelligence has created considerable unnecessary confusion because of the ordinary meanings associated with it, and for that very reason, the term is endlessly misused and abused. The essays collected here all aim to expound the true nature of AI, and to remove the ill-conceived philosophical discussions which seek answers to the wrong questions in the wrong ways. Philosophical discussions and decisions about the proper use of AI need to be based on a proper understanding of the manner in which AI-scientists achieve their results; in particular, in their dependence on the initial planning input of human beings. The collection combines the Anglo-Saxon school of analytical philosophy with scientific and psychological methods of investigation. The distinguished authors in this volume represent a cross-section of philosophers, psychologists, and computer scientists from all over the world. The result is a fascinating study in the nature and future of AI, written in a style which is certain to appeal and inform laymen and specialists alike.",N/A,N/A,en
Fault-Diagnosis Systems,['Rolf Isermann'],2006-01-16,['Technology & Engineering'],"With increasing demands for efficiency and product quality plus progress in the integration of automatic control systems in high-cost mechatronic and safety-critical processes, the field of supervision (or monitoring), fault detection and fault diagnosis plays an important role. The book gives an introduction into advanced methods of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). After definitions of important terms, it considers the reliability, availability, safety and systems integrity of technical processes. Then fault-detection methods for single signals without models such as limit and trend checking and with harmonic and stochastic models, such as Fourier analysis, correlation and wavelets are treated. This is followed by fault detection with process models using the relationships between signals such as parameter estimation, parity equations, observers and principal component analysis. The treated fault-diagnosis methods include classification methods from Bayes classification to neural networks with decision trees and inference methods from approximate reasoning with fuzzy logic to hybrid fuzzy-neuro systems. Several practical examples for fault detection and diagnosis of DC motor drives, a centrifugal pump, automotive suspension and tire demonstrate applications.",4,N/A,en

The primary focus is not on the modeling, emulation, or analysis of some biological system.

For instance, at the level of everyday experience, we can view the actions of a human operator of some process (e. g. , the driver of a car) as being a series of the best choices he or she makes in trying to achieve some goal (staying on the road); emulation of this decision-making process amounts to modeling a type of biological optimization and decision-making process, and implementation of the resulting algorithm results in “human mimicry” for automation. There are clearer examples of - ological optimization processes that are used for control and automation when you consider nonhuman biological or behavioral processes, or the (internal) - ology of the human and not the resulting external behavioral characteristics (like driving a car).
