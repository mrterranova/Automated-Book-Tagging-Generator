Dealstorming,['Tim Sanders'],2016,['Business & Economics'],"""The bestselling author of Love Is the Killer App unveils a methodology that sales managers and account executives can use to solve their team's toughest problems by combining the wisdom and creativity of everyone who has a stake in the sale. B2B sales reps often find that their deals get stuck at a crucial point in the decision-making process. This book is Tim Sanders's guide to breaking through the resistance and getting the deal unstuck using a scalable, repeatable process that he calls ""Dealstorming."" By including a diverse group of individuals in the organization who has a stake in the sale, questioning existing assumptions, and channeling the collective experience of the group, sales teams can uncover creative solutions to closing otherwise impossible deals. In Sanders's experience as a sales executive and consultant, utilizing this process has led to a stunning 70 percent close ratio. Take, for example, the way Alyssa Wichman of CareerBuilder used dealstorming to break a deadlock with staffing firm Allegis. When she found out that Allegis was sponsoring a golf tournament to raise money for their favorite nonprofit, she and her team sat down to come up with ways to meet the Allegis executives there, going so far as to take over manning a beer cart on the course to speak with the execs on the ninth hole. They were impressed she'd gone to such lengths to have a few minutes with them, so they agreed to a meeting the following week. ""--",N/A,N/A,en

Sales Audit,['Corey Hutchison'],2007,['Business & Economics'],"Executives want predictability and improvement in the performance of the business. Top-line predictability is the result of repeatable execution of a documented sales process, examination of the results, and modification of the process to assure future results. Predictability depends on auditing the selling process. Can the sales process be audited? Sales managers argue that selling is an art-form exempt from scrutiny. But to produce predictable results, the sales organization must document and interrogate its processes using 'Sarbanes-Oxley-like' rigor and 'comply' with senior management expectations. This book organizes effective sales management processes into a comprehensive, repeatable system. It distills years of observation, training, and real-world experience into a step-by-step system for auditing a sales process. How do executives view the sales team's skills and effectiveness? Is the company hiring and tracking these skills through a defined sales process? Is the company measuring the sales team on their execution using these skills? This book explores the concept of the Sales Audit and explains how to use it to achieve predictability of results through 'sales process compliance': * Align senior management expectations with those of the sales team. * Interrogate the steps of the current sales process to evaluate its effectiveness. * Measure the sales team's adherence to the process and their results. * Review the performance of the process in terms of predictability of results. * Ensure the continual improvement of the process and its future alignment with organizational results.",N/A,N/A,en
