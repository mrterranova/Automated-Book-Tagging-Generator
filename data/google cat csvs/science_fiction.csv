Technology Fiction,"['Uwe Fraunholz', 'Anke Woschech']",2014-03-15,['Technology & Engineering'],"Zu den zentralen Merkmalen der Hochmoderne zählte ein von technischen Visionen und Utopien befeuertes szientistisches Fortschrittsversprechen. Anhand historischer Fallstudien zu zeitgenössischen Technikdiskursen und den dabei vorgenommenen Bedeutungszuschreibungen untersuchen die Beiträge in diesem Band, welche Rolle technische Visionen und Utopien bei der Entstehung und für das robuste Beharrungsvermögen des omnipräsenten Technikoptimismus spiel(t)en. Neben Energie- und Mobilitätsvisionen werden spezifisch sozialistische Technikutopien sowie Medien der Popularisierung in den Blick genommen.",N/A,N/A
Science Fiction und Labour Fiction,"['Peter Seyferth', 'Falko Blumenthal']",2025-04-18,['Political Science'],"Science Fiction erfindet faszinierende Zukünfte – sie prägt aber auch die Gegenwart, nicht zuletzt durch technische Inspiration und popkulturelle Sozialisation. Was wir von der Zukunft erwarten und befürchten, das haben wir oft vorher in Science-Fiction-Geschichten gelesen oder gesehen. Dies trifft auch auf die Arbeitswelt zu: Welche technologischen Wandlungen werden uns betreffen? Welche Arbeitskämpfe stehen uns bevor? Und sind Roboter unsere Konkurrenten? Die Beiträger*innen analysieren einige dieser Arbeitszukünfte in ausgesuchten Büchern, Filmen und Spielen – und geben einen Einblick in etwas, das wir noch nicht wissen, uns aber schon vorstellen können.",N/A,N/A
Big Science Fiction – Kernfusion und Popkultur in den USA,['Simon Märkl'],2019-11-26,['History'],"Die Kernfusion, die in Wasserstoffbomben seit 1954 auf zerstörerische Weise gelingt, zur Stromerzeugung nutzbar zu machen, ist eines der ambitioniertesten Großforschungsprojekte seit dem Manhattan-Projekt. Ihre Geschichte als Zukunftstechnologie im Spiegel öffentlicher Darstellungen illustriert das wechselvolle Verhältnis der amerikanischen Gesellschaft zu den Zielen und der Richtung technologischer Entwicklung. Simon Märkl macht deutlich, dass die Kernfusion als Gegenstand medialer und kultureller Auseinandersetzung dabei zu allen Zeiten nicht nur eine neue Möglichkeit umweltfreundlicher Energieversorgung, sondern immer auch Mittel zur Propagierung politischer Werte und Vorstellungen war.",N/A,N/A
"the nucleus is the atom, the electron shells fiction",['Helmut Albert'],2021-09-05,['Science'],"With the first nuclear-shell atomic model in history in 1911, Ernest Rutherford postulated a large atomic shell with electrically negative electrons and a small electrically positive atomic nucleus. He considered the atomic nucleus to be a single positive charge around which electrons orbit, or linger, at a great distance. He did not yet know that the atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Thus the often quoted comparison of the atom with a planetary system is comprehensible. (The construction principle is still valid for today's atomic model of particle physics). However, this idea quickly becomes nonsensical if one takes into account the later discoveries of the atomic building blocks proton (1919) and neutron (1932). And this in two respects: If one assumes that proton and electron have the same opposite electric charge, then the laws of nature would have to work here as well, as they apply to cations and anions in the structure of the ion crystals. However, the same applies also to the so-called atomic nucleus and its protons and neutrons, whose nuclear force is unexplained by science until today. In the 3rd chapter, the treatise refers to this by dealing with the rotational properties and the kinetic energies of the nucleons. Also for this particle system of the so-called nucleus only one possibility of a structure exists: That of a chessboard-like structure! This e-book edition is a translated and modified treatise, of the e-book published in German in 2019: ""Der Kern ist das Atom, die Hülle ist Fiction"". The shown theory refers to the atom model with chessboard-like structure (Albert 2017)",N/A,N/A
The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film,['Steven Sanders'],2007-12-14,['Performing Arts'],"The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, ""Enigmas of Identity and Agency,"" deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, ""Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence,"" contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, ""Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism,"" looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.",4,N/A

Science Fiction Prototyping,['Brian David Johnson'],2011,['Computers'],"Science fiction is the playground of the imagination. If you are interested in science or fascinated with the future then science fiction is where you explore new ideas and let your dreams and nightmares duke it out on the safety of the page or screen. But what if we could use science fiction to do more than that? What if we could use science fiction based on science fact to not only imagine our future but develop new technologies and products? What if we could use stories, movies and comics as a kind of tool to explore the real world implications and uses of future technologies today? Science Fiction Prototyping is a practical guide to using fiction as a way to imagine our future in a whole new way. Filled with history, real world examples and conversations with experts like best selling science fiction author Cory Doctorow, senior editor at Dark Horse Comics Chris Warner and Hollywood science expert Sidney Perkowitz, Science Fiction Prototyping will give you the tools you need to begin designing the future with science fiction. The future is Brian David Johnson's business. As a futurist at Intel Corporation, his charter is to develop an actionable vision for computing in 2021. His work is called ""future casting""-using ethnographic field studies, technology research, trend data, and even science fiction to create a pragmatic vision of consumers and computing. Johnson has been pioneering development in artificial intelligence, robotics, and reinventing TV. He speaks and writes extensively about future technologies in articles and scientific papers as well as science fiction short stories and novels (Fake Plastic Love and Screen Future: The Future of Entertainment, Computing and the Devices We Love). He has directed two feature films and is an illustrator and commissioned painter. Table of Contents: Preface / Foreword / Epilogue / Dedication / Acknowledgments / 1. The Future Is in Your Hands / 2.

The Supernatural and English Fiction,['Glen Cavaliero'],1995,['History'],"This book is the first ever to describe and discuss all the principal English writers who have handled the subject of the supernatural. Among those included in Glen Cavaliero's absorbing study are James Hogg, Sheridan Le Fanu, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, Walter de la Mare, M. R. James, John Cowper Powys, William Golding, Iris Murdoch, and Muriel Spark. As well as analysing the senses in which the supernatural may be understood, he relates them to different kinds of fiction, such as the Gothic novel, the occultist romance, the ghost story, novels of paranormal psychology, nature mysticism, and late twentieth-century uses of allegory and fable. He examines the impact of supernaturalist themes upon naturalistic writers, and discusses the relevance of the supernatural to the question of the truthfulness of fiction, and to contemporary literary theory and its ideological accompaniments.",N/A,N/A

History and Fiction in Galdós's Narratives,['Geoffrey Ribbans'],1993,['Literary Criticism'],"Galdos wrote prolifically in two distinct narrative modes: some twenty major 'contemporary novels' in the realist tradition and a special sort of historical novel he called the episodio nacional. The reign of Isabella II (1843-68) and the revolutionary period which followed until 1875 was a time of exceptional volatility in Spain, and Geoffrey Ribbans's comprehensive study shows how each of Galdos's two narrative modes adopts a particular technique in its treatment of Spanish history and politics. The episodio is tightly bound to historical events and timescale, though it skilfully incorporates its fictional characters into this framework; the novel on the other hand is embedded in historical reality in a constant but less systematic manner.",N/A,N/A

"Fact, Fiction, and Forecast",['Nelson Goodman'],1983-03-07,['Philosophy'],"Here, in a new edition, is Nelson Goodman’s provocative philosophical classic—a book that, according to Science, “raised a storm of controversy” when it was first published in 1954, and one that remains on the front lines of philosophical debate. How is it that we feel confident in generalizing from experience in some ways but not in others? How are generalizations that are warranted to be distinguished from those that are not? Goodman shows that these questions resist formal solution and his demonstration has been taken by nativists like Chomsky and Fodor as proof that neither scientific induction nor ordinary learning can proceed without an a priori, or innate, ordering of hypotheses. In his new foreword to this edition, Hilary Putnam forcefully rejects these nativist claims. The controversy surrounding these unsolved problems is as relevant to the psychology of cognitive development as it is to the philosophy of science. No serious student of either discipline can afford to misunderstand Goodman’s classic argument.",N/A,N/A
