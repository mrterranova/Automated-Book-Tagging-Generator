You Didn't Hear This from Me,['Kelsey McKinney'],2025-02-11,['Psychology'],"A delightfully insightful exploration of our obsession with gossip that weaves together journalism, cultural criticism, and memoir, from the host of the massively popular Normal Gossip podcast. Can you keep a secret? As the pandemic forced us to socialize at a distance, Kelsey McKinney was mourning the juicy updates, jaw-dropping stories, and idle chatter that she'd typically collect over drinks with friends. She realized she wasn't the only one missing these little morsels and her hunger for this aspect of normalcy took on a life of its own and the blockbuster Normal Gossip podcast was born. With listenership in the millions and gossip quickly becoming her day job, Kelsey found herself with the urge to think more critically about gossip as a form, to better understand the role that it plays in our culture. In YOU DIDN'T HEAR THIS FROM ME, McKinney explores the murkiness of everyday storytelling. Why is gossip considered a sin and how can we better recognize when gossip is being weaponized against the oppressed? Why do we think we're entitled to every detail of a celebrity's personal life because they are a public figure? And how do we even define ""gossip,"" anyway? She dishes on the art of eavesdropping and dives deep into how pop culture has changed the way that we look at hearsay. But as much as the book aims to treat gossip as a subject worthy of rigor, it also hopes to capture the heart of gossiping: how enchanting and fun it can be to lean over and whisper something a little salacious into your friend's ear. With wit and honesty, McKinney unmasks what we're actually searching for when we demand to know the truth - and how much the truth really matters in the first place.",N/A,N/A,en

En el segundo año, los que sobrevivimos perdemos la compasión». --Xaden Riorson Todos esperaban que Violet Sorrengail muriera en su primer año en el Colegio de Guerra de Basgiath, incluso ella misma. Pero la Trilla fue tan solo la primera de una serie de pruebas imposibles destinadas a deshacerse de los pusilánimes, los indignos y los desafortunados. Ahora comienza el verdadero entrenamiento y Violet no sabe cómo logrará superarlo. No solo porque es brutal y agotador ni porque está diseñado para llevar al límite el umbral del dolor de los jinetes, sino porque el nuevo vicecomandante está empeñado en demostrar a Violet lo débil que es a menos que traicione al hombre que ama. Aunque el cuerpo de Violet es más frágil que el de sus compañeros, su fuerza radica en su ingenio y voluntad de hierro. Además, los líderes están olvidando la lección más importante que Basgiath les ha enseñado: los jinetes de dragones crean sus propias reglas. La voluntad de sobrevivir no será suficiente este año, porque Violet conoce el secreto que se oculta entre los muros del colegio y nada, ni siquiera el fuego de dragón, será suficiente para salvarlos.

It's not just that it's grueling and maliciously brutal, or even that it's designed to stretch the riders' capacity for pain beyond endurance. It's the new vice commandant, who's made it his personal mission to teach Violet exactly how powerless she is, unless she betrays the man she loves. . Although Violet's body might be weaker and frailer than everyone else's, she still has her wits―and a will of iron. And leadership is forgetting the most important lesson Basgiath has taught her: Dragon riders make their own rules. . But a determination to survive won't be enough this year. Because Violet knows the real secret hidden for centuries at Basgiath War College―and nothing, not even dragon fire, may be enough to save them in the end.",N/A,N/A,es

Secrets,"[""Musée d'ethnographie (Neuchâtel, Suisse).""]",2015,"['Art, Swiss']","L'exposition Secrets boucle la trilogie que le MEN et ses partenaires ont consacrée au Patrimoine culturel immatériel. Une série d'interventions dans des lieux publics de la ville de Neuchâtel illustrent l'importance, la place et le fonctionnement du secret dans la vie quotidienne, à travers des champs aussi variés que l'économie, la santé, la religion, l'intime, le juridique, les médias ou les sciences. L'idée centrale développée à cette occasion est que le secret constitue une modalité essentielle de la communication. En ce sens, il existe au moins autant pour informer que pour taire et son parcours tend vers la révélation partielle ou totale des contenus apparemment dissimulés. Objet de méfiance lorsqu'il opacifie le fonctionnement de puissantes institutions et leurs processus décisionnels, il est en revanche considéré comme indispensable lorsqu'il protège la justice, les médias, la sphère privée ou des intérêts personnels. En matière de réception, cette expérience a permis de toucher un nouveau public, peu habitué à ce qu'une exposition lui soit proposée sous la forme d'un parcours ludique, éclaté entre de multiples endroits et instaurant un perpétuel décalage avec leur usage courant. Partir ainsi à la découverte de secrets dissimulés dans l'univers urbain amenait parallèlement à intégrer l'ensemble de la promenade et des lieux traversés dans la même thématique: paradoxal patrimoine culturel immatériel, le secret se retrouvait partout, et pas uniquement là où l'équipe du MEN avait choisi de le mettre en scène. Une dizaine d'auteurs ont accepté de prolonger cette refléxion en écrivant sur différents aspects des contenus abordés.
