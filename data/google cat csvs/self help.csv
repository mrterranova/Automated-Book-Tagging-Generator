Dual-Process Theories in Moral Psychology,['Cordula Brand'],2016-03-21,['Philosophy'],"This anthology offers a unique collection of contributions focusing on the discussion about the so-called dual-process theories within the field of moral psychology. In general, dual-process theories state that in cognitive systems, two sorts of processes can be differentiated: an affective, associative process and an analytical, rule-based process. This distinction recently entered the debate on the relationship between intuitive and rational approaches to explaining the phenomenon of moral judgment. The increasing interest in these theories raises questions concerning their general impact on social contexts. The anthology aims at presenting stepping-stones of an analysis of the merits and drawbacks of this development. For that purpose, the authors discuss general questions concerning the relationship between ethics and empirical sciences, methodological questions, reassessments of established terminology and societal implications of dual-process theories in moral psychology.",5,N/A
Reasons Without Persons,['Brian Hedden'],2015,['Philosophy'],"Brian Hedden defends a radical view about rationality, personal identity, and time. He argues that what it is rational to do should not depend on your past beliefs or actions, which are not part of your current perspective on the world. His impersonal approach holds that what rationality demands of you is solely determined by your evidence.",N/A,N/A
Constructing the Self in a Mediated World,"['Debra Grodin', 'Thomas R. Lindlof']",1996-01-18,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"In today′s media-saturated world, identities are no longer built solely within the close-knit communities of family, neighborhood, school, and work. Today media are part of our world and therefore play an important role in the formulations of our identities or constructions of self. In a truly postmodern mode, Constructing the Self in a Mediated World not only brings together the usually segregated areas of interpersonal and mass communication but also incorporates works from scholars in sociology, psychology, and women′s studies as well. Each essay examines our understanding of self in a different context of mediated culture within a specific framework of interpretive theories such as critical theory, social constructionist theory, and feminism. This volume provides insights into issues of self and identity in contemporary mediated culture. Designed for advanced students and experienced researchers in communication (both media and interpersonal), sociology, psychology, and women′s studies. Constructing the Self in a Mediated World raises important questions and contributes greatly to its field.",N/A,N/A
Revisiting the Use of Self,['Deena Mandell'],2007,['Political Science'],"In recent years, several developments have stimulated new ways of thinking about the social worker's """"self"""" or """"selves"""" in all aspects of practice. The focus on practice with diverse populations, and the emphasis on """"anti-oppressive"""" practice have highlighted elements of the relationship between social worker and client. The objective of this book is threefold: 1. Offer the reader a historical/developmental overview of the concept of """"use of self"""" and critically explore its adequacy for contemporary ethical practice. 2. Provide the reader with first-person, practitioners' accounts of their own """"use of self"""" in examples of reflective practice approaches. 3. Broaden the scope of the concept of critical """"use of self"""" to fields of service where it is under-theorized in, for example, community work and corrections.",N/A,N/A

Remembering the Falklands War,['Sarah Maltby'],2016-06-23,['History'],"This book offers an empirically informed understanding of how identity and agency become wholly embedded within practices of media-remembering. It draws upon data collected from the British military, the BBC and Falkland Islanders during the 30th Anniversary of the Falklands war to uniquely offer multiple perspectives on a single ‘remembering’ phenomenon. The study offers an analysis of the convergence, interconnectedness and interdependence of media and remembering, specifically the production, interpretation and negotiation of remembering in the media ecology. In so doing it not only examines the role of media in the formation and sustaining of collective memory but also the ways those who remember or are remembered in media texts become implicated in these processes.",N/A,N/A

Psychotherapy and the Grandiose Patient,['E. Mark Stern'],1989,['Psychology'],"Here is a practical and thorough volume for any mental health professional who is working with grandiose clients. Using helpful background information and vignettes from clinical contact with their own clients, a number of psychotherapists provide new and enlightening insights into the person who displays an exaggerated sense of self-importance, a constant need for attention and admiration, a sense of entitlement, and an inability to identify and experience how others feel. Learn all about the theoretical basis of grandiosity, the functional and dysfunctional aspects of grandiosity, the possible etiological bases for the onset and maintenance of grandiosity in behavior and attitude, and the sources and consequences of grandiosity in psychotherapists, especially in interaction with grandiosity in patients. You will also better understand the relationship between grandiosity and narcissim, and the relationship between grandiosity and alcoholism, including suggestions for treating alcoholics who display grandiosity.",N/A,N/A
Ego Psychology and Social Work Practice,['Eda Goldstein'],1995-03,['Medical'],"While ego psychological theory still holds a pre-eminent position in clinical social work practice, the field has changed in many ways.

Moral Certainty and the Foundations of Morality,"[""Neil O'Hara""]",2018-03-15,['Philosophy'],"What lies at the foundation of our moral beliefs? If we dig down far enough do we find that our moral values have no ground at all to stand on, and so are apt to collapse upon serious philosophical investigation? This book seeks to answer these and related questions by positing an indubitable foundation for our moral beliefs – they arise from the phenomenon of ‘primary recognition’, and are fundamentally shaped by ‘basic moral certainties’. Drawing on philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Knud Ejler Løgstrup, this book draws together insights from both Analytic and Continental philosophy to provide a convincing new picture of our moral foundations. And it does so in a way that eschews moral conservativism and opens the way for a rich understanding of the variety and particularity of our human moral systems, while also keeping a significant place for those moral beliefs that occur universally, across cultures.",N/A,N/A
Contemporary Masculinities,['Brendan Gough'],2018-04-19,['Social Science'],"This book assesses the construction of masculinities in relation to appearance, embodiment and emotions by drawing on perspectives in psychology, sociology, gender studies and public health. Brendan Gough questions conventional assumptions about masculinity and men’s health and responds to recent trends in critical studies of masculinities which discuss ‘positive’ or ‘healthy’ masculine identities. The book showcases discursively inflected qualitative research using data sources where men’s own accounts are prioritised: in-depth interviews and online discussion forums. Chapters discuss men’s appearance concerns and activities and examine male mental health, focusing on vulnerability and its management. Current trends and key concepts, including intersectionality, inequalities and embodiment are also considered throughout. This book will appeal to students and academics within social sciences and humanities interested in gender issues in general and masculinity in particular.",N/A,N/A
Self-Determination Theory and Healthy Aging,"['Betsy Ng', 'Gloria Ho']",2020-10-20,['Family & Relationships'],"This book pioneers evidence-based research on healthy aging through the application of self determination theory (SDT). Its uniqueness is located in the fact that to date, no other work has applied SDT to the empirical study of aging populations. The authors focus on how SDT drives healthy, successful and active aging, and note that the motivation factors underpinning healthy aging are often neglected, or altogether absent, in the existing literature. This edited volume is particularly timely given the expanding aging crisis in many North American, European and Asian contexts. The collection of chapters meets this challenge head-on in comparing these contexts vis-a-vis a broad international scope, and subsequent discussions on important specialty issues in aging, such as hearing and memory loss. The work offers global perspectives on aging, autonomy and associated life challenges, as well as factors relating to the sustainability of healthy aging in terms of physical and mental well-being. This book will be highly relevant to researchers in the SDT community, as well as specialists in aging and gerontology. It will also be of interest to lifespan psychologists and developmental psychologists.",N/A,N/A
Confronting the Existential Threat of Dementia,"['Richard Cheston', 'Gary Christopher']",2019-06-12,['Psychology'],"This book explores how dementia acts as an existential threat, both to people diagnosed with the condition, and to their carers. The authors highlight how dementia not only gradually erodes our most fundamental abilities, but that it does so at a time of life when the resources of individuals, couples, and families are already stretched. While over time many people who are living with dementia are able to adapt to their diagnosis and acknowledge its impact on them, for many others it remains too threatening and painful to do this. The book draws on examples from clinical practice and experimental studies to argue that a range of responses, such as searching for long-dead parents or clinging to previous identities, all represent ways in which people living with dementia attempt to protect themselves against the emotional impact of the condition. Finally, the authors set out new ways of intervening to boost psychological resources and thereby support people in facing the existential threat of dementia.",N/A,N/A

Male Eating Disorders,['Russell Delderfield'],2018-12-05,['Social Science'],"This book takes a novel approach to the study of male eating disorders – an area that is often dominated by clinical discourses. The study of eating disorders in men has purportedly suffered from a lack of dedicated attention to personal and socio-cultural aspects. Delderfield tackles this deficiency by spotlighting a set of personal accounts written by a group of men who have experiences of disordered eating. The text presents critical interpretations that aim to situate these experiences in the social and cultural context in which these disorders occur. This discursive work is underpinned by an eclectic scholarly engagement with social psychology and sociology literature around masculinities, embodiment and fatness, belonging, punishment, stigma, and control; leading to understandings about relationships with food, body and self. This is undertaken with a reflexive element, as the personal intersects with the professional. This text will appeal to students, scholars and clinicians in social sciences, humanities, and healthcare studies, including public health.",N/A,N/A

The Oxford Handbook of Hypo-egoic Phenomena,"['Kirk Warren Brown', 'Mark R. Leary']",2017,['Philosophy'],"Egoicism, a mindset that places primary focus upon oneself, is rampant in contemporary Western cultures as commercial advertisements, popular books, song lyrics, and mobile apps consistently promote self-interest. Consequently, researchers have begun to address the psychological, interpersonal, and broader societal costs of excessive egoicism and to investigate alternatives to a ""me and mine first"" mindset. For centuries, scholars, spiritual leaders, and social activists have advocated a ""hypo-egoic"" way of being that is characterized by less self-concern in favor of a more inclusive ""we first"" mode of functioning. In recent years, investigations of hypo-egoic functioning have been examined by psychologists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and philosophers. Edited by Kirk Warren Brown and Mark R. Leary, The Oxford Handbook of Hypo-egoic Phenomena brings together an expert group of contributors to examine these groundbreaking lines of inquiry, distilling current knowledge about hypo-egoicism into an exceptional resource. In this volume, readers will fi nd theoretical perspectives from philosophy and several major branches of psychology to inform our understanding of the nature of hypo-egoicism and its expressions in various domains of life. Further, readers will encounter psychological research discoveries about particular phenomena in which hypo-egoicism is a prominent feature, demonstrating its implications for well-being, regulation of emotion, adaptive decision-making, positive social relations, and other markers of human happiness, well-being, and health. This Handbook offers the most comprehensive and thoughtful analyses of hypo-egoicism to date.",N/A,N/A
Phenomenology of Suicide,['Maurizio Pompili'],2017-10-10,['Medical'],"This book will help the reader to understand the suicidal mind from a phenomenological point of view, shedding light on the feelings of suicidal individuals and also those of clinicians. In accordance with the importance that the phenomenological approach attaches to subjectivity and sense of self as the starting points for knowledge, emphasis is placed on the need for the clinician to focus on the subjective experiences of the at-risk individual, to set aside prior assumptions, judgments, or interpretations, and to identify ways of bridging gaps in communication associated with negative emotions. The vital importance of empathy is stressed, drawing attention to the insights offered by neuroimaging studies and the role of mirror neurons in social cognition. It is widely acknowledged that when a clinician meets a person who wants to die by suicide, the clinician does not fully understand what is going on inside the mind of that individual. This book recognizes that any approach to suicide prevention must promote understanding of suicidal thoughts and feelings. The awareness that it fosters and the innovative perspectives that it presents will appeal to a wide readership.",N/A,N/A
Identity Structure Analysis and Teacher Mentorship,"['Graham Passmore', 'Amanda Turner', 'Julie Prescott']",2019-11-12,['Education'],"This book examines the benefits of applying the Identity Structure Analysis (ISA) to teacher professional development. At present no government, local authority or school is actively applying Identity Structure Analysis to monitor school improvement: in a profession where turnover is extremely high, ISA is framed as a way for professional development to meet the needs of the specific teacher. Examining idiographic ISA analyses as well as practical advice for implementing professional development programs, the authors scrutinise how ISA can be used in conjunction with mentoring to offset teacher turnover. This practical volume will be of interest and value to scholars and researchers of teacher identity and professional development, as well as researchers and policymakers interested in reducing teacher turnover.",N/A,N/A
Aging and Human Nature,"['Mark Schweda', 'Michael Coors', 'Claudia Bozzaro']",2020-01-11,['Family & Relationships'],"This book focuses on ageing as a topic of philosophical, theological, and historical anthropology. It provides a systematic inventory of fundamental theoretical questions and assumptions involved in the discussion of ageing and old age. What does it mean for human beings to grow old and become more vulnerable and dependent? How can we understand the manifestations of ageing and old age in the human body? How should we interpret the processes of change in the temporal course of a human life? What impact does old age have on the social dimensions of human existence? In order to tackle these questions, the volume brings together internationally distinguished scholars from the fields of philosophy, theology, cultural studies, social gerontology, and ageing studies. The collection of their original articles makes a twofold contribution to contemporary academic discourse. On one hand, it helps to clarify and deepen our understanding of ageing and old age by examining it from the fundamental point of view of philosophical, theological, and historical anthropology. At the same time, it also enhances and expands the discourses of philosophical, theological, and historical anthropology by systematically taking into account that human beings are essentially ageing creatures.",N/A,N/A
Overcoming Polarization in the Public Square,['Lauren Swayne Barthold'],2020-06-22,['Philosophy'],"This book describes how civic dialogue can serve as an antidote to a polarized public square. It argues that when pervasive polarization renders rational and fact-based argumentation ineffective, we first need to engage in a way that builds trust. Civic dialogue is a form of structured discourse that utilizes first-person narratives in order to promote trust, openness, and mutual understanding. By creating a dialogic structure that encourages listening and reflection, particularities and differences about fraught identities can be expressed in such a way that leads to the possibility of connecting through our fundamental, shared, and deeply felt humanity. Drawing on Plato, Buber, Gadamer, Dewey, cognitive bias research, as well as the work of dialogue practitioners, Lauren Swayne Barthold provides a sustained defense of civic dialogue as an effective strategy for avoiding futile political arguments and for creating pluralistic democratic communities.",N/A,N/A
Pride and Authenticity,['Ulrich Steinvorth'],2016-10-01,['Philosophy'],"This book explores the morality of pride, a value that has been condemned through history and is still largely unwelcome in many societies. The author explores the nature of the self and free will, and how pride links to technology and rational theology. It refers to the work of Lionel Trilling, Allan Bloom, Charles Taylor and Heidegger on authenticity; Jacob Burckhardt, Stephen Toulmin, Max Weber and Mark Lilla on modernity; Christine Korsgaard on the self; John Rawls and Ruth Benedict on morality; and the Stoics and Kant on free will.",N/A,N/A
Beyond the Psychology Industry,['Paul Rhodes'],2019-12-10,['Psychology'],"This book provides a scholarly yet accessible approach to critical psychology, specifically discussing therapeutic practices that are possible outside of the mainstream psychology industry. While there are many books that deconstruct or dismantle clinical psychology, few provide a compendium of potential alternatives to mainstream practice. Focusing on five main themes in reference to this objective: suffering, decolonization, dialogue, feminism and the arts, these pages explore types of personal inquiry, cultural knowledge or community action that might help explain and heal psychological pain beyond the confines of the therapy room. Chapters focus on the role of cultural knowledge, including spiritual traditions, relational being, art, poetry, feminism and indigenous systems in promoting healing and on community-based-initiatives, including open dialogue, justice-based collaboration and social prescribing. Beyond the Psychology Industry will be of interest to researchers, clinical psychologists, therapists, academics in mental health, and cultural psychologists.",N/A,N/A
"Self, Value, and Narrative",['Anthony Rudd'],2012-10-25,['Philosophy'],"Anthony Rudd presents a striking new account of the self as an ethical, evaluative being.

Learner Narratives of Translingual Identities,['Patrick Kiernan'],2018-08-16,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"This book addresses translingual identities through an innovative multimodal analysis of the language learning histories of a class of advanced learners of English in Japan who grew up between two or more languages. The author explores both the translingual experiences of those in the classroom and how they use language and gesture when describing their experiences to each other. This approach uses three perspectives: it looks at the worlds and identities the interviewees construct for themselves; at their interpersonal communication; and at the way they frame their experience. Finally, it offers some lessons based on the observations of the class which reveal the values they share and the key to their success as language learners. It will appeal to applied linguistic and educational researchers, particularly those with an interest in narrative approaches to exploring educational contexts, as well as language educators and policy makers interested in gaining a learner perspective on language learning.",N/A,N/A
The Psychology of Justice and Legitimacy,"['D. Ramona Bobocel', 'Aaron C. Kay', 'Mark P. Zanna', 'James M.

Medical Identities,['Kent Maynard'],2007,['Business & Economics'],"Illness and misfortune more broadly are ubiquitous; thus, healing roles or professions are also universal. Ironically, however, little attention has been paid to those who heal or promote wellbeing. These come in many different guises: in some societies, healing is highly professional and specialized; in some cases, it is more preventative, in others more interventionist. Based on rich and wide-ranging ethnographic data and especially written for this volume, these essays look at how a great variety of health providers are perceived - from traditional healers to physicians, from diviners to nursing home providers. Conversely, the authors also ask how healers, or those concerned with wider matters of well being, view themselves and to what degree social attitudes differ in regard to who these people are, as well as their power, prestige and activities. As these essays demonstrate, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, or state policy may all play formative roles in shaping the definition of health and wellbeing, how they are delivered, and the character and prestige of those who provide for our health and welfare in society.",N/A,N/A
Sacred Selfishness,['Bud Harris'],2005,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","While growing up, selfishness is defined for most people as a destructive force -- power-driven, self-obsessed, a tyranny against others, and a drain on energy. Early lessons teach that the needs of others must be put above one's own. This has created a culture of outward-directed people, cut off from the inner sources of energy and vitality. Failing to develop one's individuality can eventually lead to depression and ill health. Only after becoming whole can one help others as well as society. This is the lesson of Sacred Selfishness, in which Jungian analyst Bud Harris argues persuasively that one must live authentically in order to be whole, happy, healthy, and a truly contributing member of society. This essential guide offers many strategies readers can use in order to live a ""sacredly selfish"" life, from analyzing dreams to keeping a detailed journal that teaches seekers to understand themselves, their worth, and their needs.",3,N/A
The Study of the Meaning of Life,['Zhengyu Sun'],2024-10-28,['Philosophy'],"Based on the revelation and analysis of the social self-consciousness contained in the individual self-consciousness of the meaning of life, the book discusses the human life-world, spiritual world, cultural world and meaning-world. Then, it states the life-world, modes of thought, values ideas, aesthetic consciousness and ultimate concerns of modern humans. It also systematically expounds on the cultivation, the truth, the nurture, the sublimation, the support, the tension and the source of the spiritual home in perspectives of education, science, art, philosophy, theory, mentality and ideals. Constructing a fulfilling spiritual home for man is the realistic meaning of this book.",N/A,N/A
Body Disownership in Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,['Yochai Ataria'],2018-05-11,['Psychology'],"This book explores the long-term outcomes of severe and ongoing trauma—particularly complex posttraumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD)—from phenomenological and cognitive perspectives. For example, C-PTSD can result in impairments at the body-schema level. In order to survive, trauma victims may conduct their lives at the body-image level, thus producing a mismatch between body schema and body image. In turn, as in the case of somatoparaphrenia and body integrity identity disorder, this incongruity can result in body disownership, which will affect long-term outcomes of severe and ongoing trauma.",N/A,N/A
Humanising Higher Education,"['Camila Devis-Rozental', 'Susanne Clarke']",2020-11-16,['Psychology'],"This book explores humanising practice within higher education (HE). It provides a fresh perspective by bringing together expert voices with empirical experience of humanising theory and practice in various areas of higher education, in order to influence and improve the way in which universities work. The book draws on Todres et. al’s humanisation framework, as well other relevant theories such as positive organisational scholarship, Vygotsky’s socio-cultural theory and socio-emotional intelligence. Topics include micro elements of humanisation such as transitions and the student experience, and macro elements such as the policy impact of humanising HE and sustainability. The authors demonstrate how a humanising approach can provide the catalyst for wider change and help to improve wellbeing in the community. This book offers an invaluable resource for scholars interested in teaching and learning in HE, and for HE practitioners and policy makers keen to develop a more human practice.",N/A,N/A
The Films of Lars von Trier and Philosophy,"['José A. Haro', 'William H.

The book addresses von Trier’s films in order of their release. The earlier chapters discuss his Golden Heart trilogy and USA: Land of Opportunities series by addressing issues of potential misogyny, ethical critique, and racial justice. The later chapters focus on his Depression Trilogy and address the undermining of gender binaries, the psychoanalytic meaning of the sacrifice of children and depression, and philosophical questions provoked by the depiction of the end of the world. Taken together, the volume explores the topics of Philosophical Psychology, Social Theory, Political Theory, Theories of the Self, Philosophy of Race, and Feminist Thought, and opens a conversation about von Trier’s important work.",N/A,N/A
Falling Awake,['Todd L. Blattner'],2016-11-29,['Self-Help'],"Waking is a natural shift from unconsciousness to awareness. Falling awake is a special case of waking where we relax out of old patterns, ease out of resistance, and surrender to the grace and love that are always present beneath the surface of appearances. Although falling awake, like falling asleep, cannot be forced, it can be prepared for. Integrating perspectives from physical, social and psychological sciences, philosophy, religion and energy awareness, and calling on many years of experience as a teacher, counsellor and Buddhist monk, Blattner takes us step by step into an expanded understanding of the universe in which we live, the mind/body system that we call ""self "", and that which may lie beyond. With gentleness and kindness, Falling Awake shows us how to move beyond the programs and limiting belief systems that support the problems in our lives, and awaken into an increasingly gentle, joyful, and expanded experience of the art of living....",N/A,N/A
Beyond Identities: Human Becomings in Weirding Worlds,['Jim Dator'],2022-08-31,['Philosophy'],"This book is an argument for moving beyond culturally/historically/ethnically/biologically-grounded identity as the necessary foundation of an authentic self. It highlights examples of people who are attempting to inhabit identities they feel are more appropriate to themselves, by deploring the damage done via claims about authentic identity. The sole theme of this book is “becoming beyond identity”. We are not fixed human beings but rather perpetually-dynamic human becomings. As intelligence is enabled or recognized beyond the merely human, we should welcome our continuing evolution from homosapiens, sapiens, into many varieties of intelligences on Earth and the cosmos. This book builds from tiny ripples into a tsunami of examples from conventional identity studies, to Confucian human becomings, to apotemnophilia, to DIY biohacking, to cyborgs, to artilects, to hiveminds, to intelligence in animals, plants and fungi from the Holocene through the beginnings of the precarious, climate change-driven Anthropocene Epoch, with hints far beyond and throughout the cosmos. From a lifetime of work in future studies, anticipation science and space studies, the author balances frank tales of his own experiences and beliefs concerning his uncertain and fluid identities with those of others who tell their stories. In addition to material from academic and popular sources, a few poems further illuminate the scene.",N/A,N/A

The Dialogical Self Theory in Education,"['Frans Meijers', 'Hubert Hermans']",2017-10-20,['Education'],"This edited volume offers cross-country and cross-cultural applications of Dialogical Self Theory within the field of education. It combines the work of internationally recognized authors to demonstrate how theoretical and practical innovations emerge at the highly fertile interface of external and internal dialogues. The Theory, developed by Hubert Hermans and his colleagues in the past 25 years, responds fruitfully to the issue of educational experts hitherto working in splendid isolation and does so by combining two aspects of Dialogical Self Theory: the dialogue among individuals as well as dialogical processes within individuals, in this context students and teachers. It is the first book in which Dialogical Self Theory is applied to the field of education. In 13 chapters, authors from different cultures and continents produce theoretical considerations and a wide variety of practical procedures showing that this interface is an ideal ground for the production of new theoretical, methodological, and practical approaches that enrich the work of educational researchers and specialists. Academics, practitioners, and postgraduate students in the field of education, particularly those who are interested in the innovative and community-enhancing potentials of dialogue, will find this book valuable and informative. Ultimately the work presented here is intended to inspire more self-reflection and creative ways to engage in new conversations that can respond to real-world issues and in which education can play a more vital role.",N/A,N/A
Self-restoration of People Living with HIV/AIDS in China,['Rongting Hou'],2020-10-28,['Psychology'],"This book adopts an approach based on relational psychoanalysis, developed in the USA in and since the 1990s and guided by the self-psychology championed by Kohut and the Post-Kohutians. How people infected with HIV/AIDS live their lives is a growing concern in China. The book, based on relational psychoanalysis, explores their self-restoration, and more specifically, how adopting an attitude of “dying to live” helps them face tremendous challenges in life. By interviewing selected individuals at a given organization, the author focuses on their life experiences and on corresponding interventional mechanisms. The book’s three most important features are as follows: 1) its application of self-psychology by Heinz Kohut into the context of psychological intervention; 2) a wealth of qualitative data gathered through in-depth interviews; and 3) the author’s self-reflection and analysis. The book offers a valuable guide for graduate students, researchers, and policymakers alike. By interviewing selected individuals at a given organization, the book focuses on the life histories of selected individuals after being diagnosed with AIDS (screening HIV positive) and on corresponding interventional mechanisms. Further, itemploys the self and self-object as key explanatory terms for the necessary psychotherapeutic interventions,and in order to create guidelines that sufficiently reflect the illness and corresponding interventions. Given its scope and focus, the book offers a valuable guide for graduate students, researchers, and policymakers alike.",N/A,N/A

Handbook of Trait Narcissism,"['Anthony D. Hermann', 'Amy B. Brunell', 'Joshua D. Foster']",2018-09-27,['Psychology'],"This unique reference surveys current theoretical and empirical advances in understanding individual differences in narcissistic personality, as well as the latest perspectives on controversies in the field. Wide-ranging expert coverage examines the many manifestations of narcissism, including grandiose, vulnerable, communal, and collective varieties. Narcissism’s etiology, the role of social media culture in its maintenance and amplification, and the complex phenomena of narcissistic leadership, spirituality, friendship, and love are just a snapshot of topics that are examined. The book’s section on intrapersonal processes delves into how the narcissistic mind works, as well as how narcissists feel about themselves and their peers. It also investigates narcissists’ grasp of emotions. Chapters explore associated personality traits and numerous other important correlates of narcissistic personality. New approaches to research, assessment methods, and opportunities for intervention—bothimmediate and long-term, are discussed throughout. In addition, trait narcissism is examined in an even-handed manner that incorporates state-of-the-art research into antecedents and consequences (both good and bad) of narcissistic personality. Among the topics in the Handbook: What separates narcissism from self-esteem? A social-cognitive perspective. The many measures of grandiose narcissism. Parents’ socialization of narcissism in children. What do narcissists know about themselves? Exploring the bright spots and blind spots of narcissists’ self-knowledge. Understanding and mitigating narcissists’ low empathy. Interpersonal functioning of narcissistic individuals and implications for treatment engagement. Offering nuanced analysis of a particularly timely subject, The Handbook of Trait Narcissism is fascinating and informative reading for psychologists and psychology students, as well as scholars in anthropology, sociology, economics, political scientists, and more.",5,N/A

Over the last few years L2 motivation research has taken an exciting new turn by focusing increasingly on the language learner's situated identity and various self-perceptions.

For women seeking spiritual fulfillment of self, Rabuzzi points out the way of the mother, replacing the androcentric myths of the West with gynocentric myths based on the archetypal model of the Goddess. In contrast to the selfhood for which the hero quests, ""motherself"" is the name for what women achieve when they follow the way of the mother.

I will certainly revisit the book... when you′re ready for a challenge, this book is certainly worth dipping into′ - Counselling News `I thoroughly recommend this book. I found it challenging, provocative, exciting and full of delights. (It makes such a change to be told that ideal personality characteristics would include a Monty Pythonesque sense of humour and a tolerance of mind-altering drugs!) While reading it I often felt nourished and refreshed′ - The Journal of Critical Psychology, Counselling and Psychotherapy With the emergence of postmodern thinking, the notion of a unified, singular `self′ appears increasingly problematic. Yet for many, postmodernism′s proclamation of `the death of the subject′ is equally problematic. As a response to this dilemma, there has been a rise of interest in pluralistic models of the `self′ in which the person is conceptualized as a multiplicity of subpersonalities, as a plurality of existential possibilities or as a `being′ which is inextricably in-dialogue-with-others. Bringing together many disciplines, and with contributions from foremost writers on self-pluralism, The Plural Self overviews and critiques this emerging field. Drawing together theory, research and practice, the book expands on both the psychological and philosophical theories underlying and associated with self-pluralism, and presents empirical evidence in support of the self-pluralistic perspective, exploring its application within a clinical and therapeutic setting.",N/A,N/A
Emotion-focused Couples Therapy,"['Leslie S. Greenberg', 'Rhonda N. Goldman']",2008,['Psychology'],"In Emotion-Focused Couples Therapy: The Dynamics of Emotion, Love, and Power, authors Leslie S.

They expand its framework to focus more intently on the development of the self and the relationship system through the promotion of self-soothing and other-soothing; to deal with unmet needs both from the client's adulthood and childhood; and to work more explicitly with emotions, specifically fear, anxiety, shame, power, joy, and love. The authors discuss the affect regulation involved in three major motivational systems central to couples therapy - attachment, identity, and attraction and clarify emotions and motivations in the dominance dimension of couples' interactions.Written with practitioners and graduate students in mind, the authors use a rich variety of case material to demonstrate how working with emotions can facilitate change in couples and, by extension, in all situations where people may be in emotional conflict with others. Greenberg and Goldman provide the tools needed to identify specific emotions and show the reader how to work with them to resolve conflict and promote bonding in couples therapy.",N/A,N/A

Developmentally Based Psychotherapy formulates therapeutic processes that enable patients to build psychological capacities formerly thought to be beyond the reach of psychotherapy such as altering basic expectations, mood, and temperament; transforming impulses and behaviors into affects and mental representations; and forming new internalized object relationships, organizations of self, and capacities for self observation.

"Moral Selves, Evil Selves",['Steven Hitlin'],2008-09-15,['Philosophy'],"People have strong moral beliefs about right and wrong, yet commonly act contrary to those beliefs. Most of us, at some time or another, have crossed a moral line and yet still view ourselves as moral and have a clean conscience. From intimate relationships to national politics, we define ourselves in large part by how we – and our friends, family, and members of our social groups – draw moral lines around our actions, thoughts, and intentions. While philosophers have weighed in on these issues for thousands of years, social scientists often underplay social life’s moral dimension. Moral Selves, Evil Selves highlights our individual sense of moral coherence and develops a theory of the development and maintenance of this sense in an ambiguous and complicated social world. By conceptualizing a social psychology of conscience, this book explains how we can properly include individual and societal notions of morality into understanding the self across time and situation.",N/A,N/A

Cross-cultural Differences in Perspectives on the Self,"['Virginia Murphy-Berman', 'John J.

Considered in these pages are cross-cultural differences in the idea of the person and in models of balancing obligations to the self, family, and community. Revisiting and questioning the concepts of self and self-worth, the authors investigate the extent to which factors traditionally associated with psychological effectiveness (intrinsic motivation; assuming personal responsibility for one's actions; and feeling in control, unique, hopeful, and optimistic) are culturally bound. Hazel Markus and Shinobu Kitayama consider cultural differences in models of psychological agency; Joan Miller critiques the meaning of the term agency, analyzing the extent to which many popular theories in psychology rest on rather narrow Western models of behavior and effective functioning; Steven Heine calls into question the presumed universality of some forms of cognitive processing; Sheena Iyengar and Sanford DeVoe apply a cross-cultural perspective to better understand intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and the value of choice; Kuo-shu Yang questions the universality of the pervasive and popular ""theory of self-actualization"" formulated by Abraham Maslow; and finally, Ype Poortinga reexamines not only the cultural boundaries of theory but also the very meaning of the concept of culture itself.

Before we can know God, or ourselves, we must come to a moment of recognition. How this comes to be, as well as the terms of such acknowledgment, are worked out in Podmore's powerful new reading of Kierkegaard. As he gives full consideration to Kierkegaard's writings, Podmore explores themes such as despair, anxiety, melancholy, and spiritual trial, and how they are broken by the triumph of faith, forgiveness, and the love of God. He confronts the abyss between the self and the divine in order to understand how we can come to know ourselves in relation to a God who is apparently so wholly Other.",N/A,N/A

Early Adolescence and the Search for Self,"['Douglas Schave', 'Barbara Schave']",1989-06-23,['Family & Relationships'],"This study achieves a new perspective to this very creative and volatile time of life. The Schaves offer a better and more positive understanding of the developmental tasks of early adolescence and fully describes the states of mind, the struggles of self-differentiation and the coping styles used by this age group to protect against shame. In addition, they provide a systematic approach to treatment strategies, techniques and problem solving with adolescents and their families. This book is a trail-blazer on many grounds. . . . It makes a contribution to the literature on adolescence by offering an entirely new--and clinically highly relevant--explanation to a period of life when rapid changes in psychic organization can turn the tide either toward a wholesome development or toward serious derailments and psychopathology. Anna Ornstein The first book to focus specifically on early adolescence, this study achieves a new perspective to this very creative and volatile time of life. Drawing from their professional experience and their private practices, the authors provide a stimulating integration of self psychology, Piaget's cognitive developmental theory, and affect theory. They also elaborate on several important ideas presented in the revolutionary book, The Interpersonal World of the Infant by Daniel N. Stern. This book offers a better and more positive understanding of the developmental tasks of early adolescence. The authors consider the adolescent's search for self identity and self esteem, a function of cognitive growth as well as affect attunement and self-differentiation. The cognitive and emotional search for selfhood further results in the development of defense mechanisms. This book provides a completely different perspective for mental health professionals. It fully describes the volatile states of mind, the struggles of self-differentiation and the coping styles used by this age group to protect against shame. In addition, it provides a systematic approach to treatment strategies, techniques and problem solving with adolescents and their families. Mental health professionals as well as parents of early adolescents will find Early Adolescence and the Search for Self a thought provoking study. The reader is introduced to four main themes developed throughout this book: The primary of affects and affect attunement from infancy through early adolescence; the continued importance of parents in the development of self; The distinct states of mind experienced by early adolescents, and finally; Adolescence as the period of consolidation of cognitive thinking.",N/A,N/A

Hidden Paths,['Chiara Thumiger'],2007,['Performing Arts'],"Hidden paths analyses the representation of character in Greek tragedy, focusing on one of the most important and controversial theatre plays of all times the Bacchae. Euripides' last play has always been a favourite, enjoying an enormous success for centuries on and off the stage. This book argues that in the representation of characters in the play we can find a development in the view of self and representation of man. This development, which is also to be partly traced in the works of Sophocles and in earlier plays by Euripides, finds a fuller expression in the Bacchae and culminates in the catastrophe of ignorance and incommunicability which has Pentheus at its centre. The construction of character in the text and the view of self which it entails are explored through a meticulous analysis of keywords, while verbal usage, imagery and style are exposed as the very 'stuff' of characterisation. The book uncovers the 'hidden paths' along which human life is experienced in the play and through which human characterisation materializes from the fabric of the text.",N/A,N/A

Treatment Of Alcoholism And Other Addictions,['Jerome D. Levin'],1987,['Medical'],"This comprehensive volume provides a solid understanding of the inner world of alcoholism, the dynamics of this disorder, and a range of therapeutic interventions to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy in treating alcoholic patients. Levin's approach to the treatment of alcoholism serves as a model for the therapy of other addictions as well. He draws on material from across the sciences, along with the basic principles of psychoanalysis, focusing on the concepts of transference, countertransference, therapeutic alliance, resistance, and internalization and their application to the psychodynamic treatment of individuals involved in self-help programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. The emphasis is basically on the self psychology developed by Heinz Kohut and his followers. This is a developmental view that considers alcoholism a disorder of self- a form of self-pathology, the essential characteristic being compulsiveness. The disorder is seen in terms of ego and self-deficits stemming from failure in internalization of the functions performed by the idealized self-object. A regression to, or a fixation at, pathological narcissism results. The addict attempts to self-medicate this deficit so as not to appear dependent on others. This accounts for the dependency conflicts that are so evident in alcoholics and other addicts. What must be internalized in not alcohol but the capacity to perform the functions of alcohol. This process of replacement is the thrust of the therapy. Alcoholism and substance abuse result in pervasive damage to the individual's physical, mental, and spiritual existence and have drastic consequences to their families and to society at large. This book is a major step toward meeting the critical need and demand for effective treatment. -- from Book Jacket.",N/A,N/A

Taking as her main example the situation of India's Dalits, Dhanda argues that overall personal identity is to be understood as the outcome of an on-going process of negotiation above all between these two elements. Given the centrality of the roles played by different and often over-lapping conceptions of what constitutes identity not only in the world of theoretical debate, but also in that of political and personal practice, Dhanda's arguments in favour of seeing these matters in terms of negotiation rather than in those of simple and mutually un-comprehending conflict will be of very great interest to all concerned with the many problems of personal and inter-communal experience to-day.""

Cross-cultural Differences in Perspectives on the Self,"['Virginia Murphy-Berman', 'John J. Berman']",2003,['Political Science'],"Cross-Cultural Difference in Perspectives on the Self features the latest research in a dynamic area of inquiry and practice. Considered in these pages are cross-cultural differences in the idea of the person and in models of balancing obligations to the self, family, and community. Revisiting and questioning the concepts of self and self-worth, the authors investigate the extent to which factors traditionally associated with psychological effectiveness (intrinsic motivation; assuming personal responsibility for one's actions; and feeling in control, unique, hopeful, and optimistic) are culturally bound. Hazel Markus and Shinobu Kitayama consider cultural differences in models of psychological agency; Joan Miller critiques the meaning of the term agency, analyzing the extent to which many popular theories in psychology rest on rather narrow Western models of behavior and effective functioning; Steven Heine calls into question the presumed universality of some forms of cognitive processing; Sheena Iyengar and Sanford DeVoe apply a cross-cultural perspective to better understand intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and the value of choice; Kuo-shu Yang questions the universality of the pervasive and popular ""theory of self-actualization"" formulated by Abraham Maslow; and finally, Ype Poortinga reexamines not only the cultural boundaries of theory but also the very meaning of the concept of culture itself.

This Sub-Project Is A Part And Extension Of The Ongoing Project Of History Of Indian Science, Philosophy And Culture [Phispc]. Science Has Been Descrived Both As Abstract And Concrete. Mathematical Language, Constructive Orientation And The Invisible Universality Of Scientific Laws Make It Abstract. But When Its Dependence On Human Experience And Practice Is Recalled, Science Is Felt To Be Concrete And Close To Common Sense. Science Is Social In A Double Sense. No Individual In His Isolation Can Create Science. He Is Influenced By The Views Of Others, Predecessors And Contemporaries, And Scientific Truth-Claims Need To Be Attested At Least In Principle By All. Sociology Of Science Is A Valid Form Of Knowledge. Without Peer Endorsement And Acceptance No New Scientific Theory Is Recognized As Truly Scientific. Of Course The Validation Of Science Is A More Comprehensive Affair Than The Mere Sociological Approval Of It. In Science, Diverse Information About The World Are Sought To Be Systematized In Terms Of Laws. The Attempted Systematization Of Knowledge In Science Takes Alternative Forms. History And Philosophy Of Science Are Replete With The Examples Of These Alternatives. The Ptolemaic And Copernican Models In Astronomy, The Newtonian And Quantum Physics Are Among The Most Well-Known Examples Of This Point. Not Only Scientific Communities But Also Individual Scientists Author These Changing Alternative Models. Many Philosophically Inclined Scientists Maintain That The Ultimate Principle Of Scientific Systematization Is The Human Self, Psychological Or Presuppositional. The Self Enters The Domain Of Science Both In The Context Of Its Origination And Also In That Of Its Validation. The Self Has Been Explicated Behaviourally, Introspectively And Transcendentally. All These Interpretations Of The Self And Their Relation To The Society And Science Have Been Discussed In The Papers Of This Book.

It provides an overview of the development of his thought on self and society and reveals the extent of his contribution to the field of mental health. Jill Savege Scharff introduces Sutherland's most important and influential essays. These reflect his range as a theoretician, moving easily from the intrapsychic to the interpersonal level, building bridges between points of view and integrating psychoanalytic and social theories. Sutherland's work calls for changes at the individual level through understanding conflicts and unconscious processes as aspects of parts of the self in interaction. He inspires respect and understanding of the self and its drive toward autonomy. These papers push the boundaries of psychoanalytic thinking and succeed in demonstrating the relevance of psychoanalysis to the wider society.

The Things of the World,['James A. Aho'],1998-10-30,['Education'],"What does it mean to be a social being in the ordinary life-world? This clear and compelling introduction to social phenomenology examines the experiential features of the basic things comprising our life-world, namely me, you, abstract others (enemies, communities, and associations), and attributes of the lived-body (emotions, pain, and pleasure). Each of these entities is phenomenologically described, with the aim of reducing reports of personal experiences and other primary documents to the presumed prototypical experience of the thing in question—its ideal essence. Another aim of this study is to sociologically account for how the various entities of the life-world have been accomplished, that is, how the prototypical experiences of the things in question have come to be. By showing the life-world to be our joint project rather than a fixed, unalterable coherency, this volume destabilizes our naive attitude towards the things of the world. Examples are drawn from the author's own research on issues such as violence, religion, health, and race; from classic and contemporary anthropological research; and from the works of some of the most innovative philosophers of the twentieth century. This study actually does phenomenology instead of merely arguing for its necessity and will appeal to both social scientists and philosophers.",N/A,N/A

Sources of the Self,['Charles Taylor'],1989-11,['Philosophy'],"“Taylor has taken on the most delicate and exacting of philosophical questions, the question of who we are and how we should live...and he has made this an adventure of self-discovery for his reader.” —Martha Nussbaum, New Republic In this extensive inquiry into the sources of modern selfhood, Charles Taylor demonstrates just how rich and precious those resources are. The modern turn to subjectivity, with its attendant rejection of an objective order of reason, has led—it seems to many—to mere subjectivism at the mildest and to sheer nihilism at the worst. Many critics believe that the modern order has no moral backbone and has proved corrosive to all that might foster human good. Taylor rejects this view. He argues that, properly understood, our modern notion of the self provides a framework that more than compensates for the abandonment of substantive notions of rationality. The major insight of Sources of the Self is that modern subjectivity, in all its epistemological, aesthetic, and political ramifications, has its roots in ideas of human good. After first arguing that contemporary philosophers have ignored how self and good connect, the author defines the modern identity by describing its genesis. His effort to uncover and map our moral sources leads to novel interpretations of most of the figures and movements in the modern tradition. Taylor shows that the modern turn inward is not disastrous but is in fact the result of our long efforts to define and reach the good. At the heart of this definition he finds what he calls the affirmation of ordinary life, a value which has decisively if not completely replaced an older conception of reason as connected to a hierarchy based on birth and wealth. In telling the story of a revolution whose proponents have been Augustine, Montaigne, Luther, and a host of others, Taylor’s goal is in part to make sure we do not lose sight of their goal and endanger all that has been achieved. Sources of the Self provides a decisive defense of the modern order and a sharp rebuff to its critics.",N/A,N/A

Interpersonal Boundaries reveals the complexities of the self and its boundaries, while identifying some of the enigmatic questions about how the biological, psychological, and cultural aspects of the self interrelate. The contributors skillfully integrate a wide range of theory with a wealth of clinical material. Examples range from the dark side of boundary-violating therapists to an extraordinary presentation of harrowing analytic work with a severely traumatized man.

Culture and Developing Selves: Beyond Dichotomization,"['Michael F. Mascolo', 'Jin Li']",2004-07,['Education'],"The distinction between individualism and collectivism (I-C) has been useful in understanding differences in the world's cultures and the developing selves that they spawn. Contributing chapters to this volume examine the multiplicity of developing selfhood that exists within and between cultures. In so doing, they explore the coexistence of self-cultivation and social obligation among the Chinese, the coexistence of deep spiritual interiority and social duty in urban India, changing patterns of identity in immigrant families, and how autonomy functions in the service of social relations among American adolescents. A uniting theme in the chapters argues that individuality and connectedness cannot exist independent of each other. Although there are dramatic differences in how they are constructed, individual and communal dimensions of selfhood must be represented in some form in selves that develop in all cultures. The traditional view of I-C holds that in individualist (most North American and Western-European) cultures, individuals develop a sense of self as separate, autonomous, and independent of others. In contrast, collectivist cultures (for example, many Asian cultures) place primary value on group orientation, the goals and needs of others, and readiness to cooperate. However, despite its utility, the I-C dimension can obscure an analysis of the complexity of selves that develop in individualist and collectivist cultures. Individuality and interiority are represented in selves that develop within cultures considered collectivistic; conversely; selves in individualist cultures are defined through relations with others. This work represents a breakthrough in understanding the complex and inter-related issues of I-C in both individualist and collectivist cultures. This is the 104th volume of the Jossey-Bass quarterly report series New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development.",N/A,N/A

Exploring the globalised therapeutic culture of today, the book argues that psychology as 'science' is often abandoned to aid the individual pursuit for self-realization and self-optimization. Opposing the view that self-help culture is external to psychology, Madsen argues that it is firmly embedded within psychology, playing an important role in people's lives. Each chapter traces and critically interprets a range of self-help philosophies and techniques, examining the claims of self-help literature to represent the most innovative psychological, medical or neurobiological research. Discussing each genre in turn, chapters examine key research alongside self-help literature to explore the effectiveness and impact of leading self-help genres in various social contexts and environments. The book offers a contemporary critical overview of issues concerning self-help, combining critical psychology with the theory of social representation to provide a broad perspective on self-help as a valid psychology. Optimizing the Self will be of interest to academics, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of social representation, critical and cultural psychology and theory, clinical psychology, and the sociology of culture and science. The book will also be of use to critical and cultural psychologists and theorists, as well as clinical psychologists.",N/A,N/A
How to Stop Reading Self-Help Books,['Scott A. Cherry'],2012-04-01,['Self-Help'],"A world full of self-help books and we still need help. One self-help book followed by another, like cars rolling off an assembly line. And so the cycle of reading continues. We've become addicted to self-help books. What's gone wrong? As we grab the next self-help book, barely having finished the last, we've assumed the genre reflects and satisfies our need for self-fulfilment. And yet, it's always playing catch-up. I examine how the self-help genre is embedded in a dominant ideological current running through ever-increasing parts of our culture. The individual is the site where all the fixing work takes place. Single answers. Easy fixes. Single individuals. Through detailed analysis of the mundane practices of everyday life, I show that there is another ideology, operating in tandem but concealed because of its 'mundaneness', through which we're finding ourselves. What we crave is to engage in the shared production of our lives. We want to be like other people. The self-help book genre is preventing us from being genuine individuals. We must place the individual back in the social. I pursue this analysis using critical thinking; I recommend that you follow my lead.",N/A,N/A

The Vertical Self,['Mark Sayers'],2010,['Holiness'],"It's time for a return to Radical Holiness. Welcome to the 21st century where you can now purchase and exchange personalities, depending on mood and circumstance; where you are told that you can be anyone you want to be, and identity is no longer based in a sense of self but rather in the imagery you choose at that moment. The Bible contains a radically different way of understanding our identity. The path that God has chosen for us to discover who we really are is the path of holiness. The most exciting thing is that this path is not for otherworldy saints, rather it is a path of earthy, gutsy holiness. It's a path that is not about basing your life on this world or of shunning your desires. Instead, it is about bringing your hopes, your dreams, your brokenness, your desires, your humanness under the Lordship of Christ. By doing this we don't just discover a new way of living out our faith, we discover a liberating, revolutionary, life-embracing way of being truly human.",N/A,N/A

The Realizations of the Self,"['Andrea Altobrando', 'Takuya Niikawa', 'Richard Stone']",2018-09-11,['Philosophy'],"Recent discussions of self-realization have devolved into unscientific theories of self-help. However, this vague and often misused concept is connected to many important individual and social problems. As long as its meaning remains unclear, it can be abused for social, political, and commercial malpractices. To combat this issue, this book shares perspectives from scholars of various philosophical traditions. Each chapter takes new steps in asking what the meaning of self-realization is–both in terms of what it means to understand who or what one is, and also in terms of how one can, or should, fulfilll oneself. The conceptual elucidations achieved from both theoretical and practical perspectives allow for a more mature awareness of how to deal with discourses on self-realization and, in any case, can help to demystify the subject.",N/A,N/A

Talking to My Selves,['Debbie Unterman'],2009-04-30,['Self-Help'],"Author and Clinical Hypnotherapist, Debbie Unterman presents an intriguing view into the intricacies of the psyche in a warm, relaxed writing style that draws the reader in. Offering extensive insight into the archetypal patterns that both hinder and guide us, she gives us permission to just be. The unveiling of our true authentic self, she suggests, occurs by unifying our many selves. In this time of upheaval and change here is a guidebook that teaches us how to love ourselves. Worn out belief systems crumble as we hear the stories of healing and transformation in the author and her clients, while the chapter on The Shadow warns that when we try to disown any parts of ourselves we can instigate self-sabotage. Unterman claims this explains the ubiquitous scandals which make headlines and plague so many religious, business, and political leaders today.Many books help readers recognize the burden of the pain they carry, but this one goes beyond traditional psychological analysis to outline the necessity of emotional expression and spiritual integration. The thoughtful self-help exercises at the end of each chapter offer the reader a clear path to cleanse old wounds and initiate change.Debbie Unterman is a Master Alchemist who, since 1983, has helped people navigate through the resources available in their subconscious minds to find creative solutions for their emotional concerns. Through her insight and powerful intuition she has the ability to help people see themselves in new ways and is constantly creating methods to share her gifts with others. In her pursuit to help people uncover solutions to annoying ordinary problems in a radical new way, which often bypasses the need for either mediation or therapy, she created two therapy-based board games for which she has received critical acclaim—Clarity: The Game of Your Life and Satori: The Game of Radical Forgiveness—where people actually “play” their way through their personal issues.She has an inquiring mind with a desire to connect, communicate and touch people deeply. Her listening skills, keen perception and spiritual clarity motivate her students and clients. Professionally she is well known for her work with survivors of childhood abuse, her innovative solution to Co-dependency and helping couples “re-wire” faulty connections between their Sub-personalities through creative communication techniques. Debbie describes herself as a “private eye for the soul, helping people find themselves and restore lost dreams.” She is driven by a spiritual purpose to empower others to break through their fears, explore the depths of their soul and connect with their own beauty and inner truth. Her compassion, authenticity and enthusiasm are inspirational. Her skill in Sub-personality work is described well by one of her clients, who is a licensed counselor in Northern California: “Debbie has the rare gift of catching the nuances of the psyche. She masterfully found so many parts of me that were begging to be heard.” Debbie calls the process she describes in this book of coming to know and understand yourself through discovering and listening to the voices of your Sub-personalities, Inner Voice Integration. Debbie explains: “This book didn't simply come from my years of studying with experts in the fields of psychology, spirituality, philosophy and wellness. It's also based on over a quarter century of personally observing the workings of the subconscious minds of thousands of clients who had wonderful results from the work we did - and I went through the same therapy myself. I cleared my own psyche of complexes and Co-dependency, healed my body of chronic stomach pain and discovered my Inner Guides - for a complete mind/body/spirit healing - just like my book helps readers begin to do. Now I want to share this knowledge that there's hope, you're not alone, and it's fun to get to know all your different selves.",N/A,N/A
Phenomenology of Suicide,['Maurizio Pompili'],2017-10-10,['Medical'],"This book will help the reader to understand the suicidal mind from a phenomenological point of view, shedding light on the feelings of suicidal individuals and also those of clinicians. In accordance with the importance that the phenomenological approach attaches to subjectivity and sense of self as the starting points for knowledge, emphasis is placed on the need for the clinician to focus on the subjective experiences of the at-risk individual, to set aside prior assumptions, judgments, or interpretations, and to identify ways of bridging gaps in communication associated with negative emotions. The vital importance of empathy is stressed, drawing attention to the insights offered by neuroimaging studies and the role of mirror neurons in social cognition. It is widely acknowledged that when a clinician meets a person who wants to die by suicide, the clinician does not fully understand what is going on inside the mind of that individual. This book recognizes that any approach to suicide prevention must promote understanding of suicidal thoughts and feelings. The awareness that it fosters and the innovative perspectives that it presents will appeal to a wide readership.",N/A,N/A

How We Break,['Vincent Deary'],2025-05-20,['Psychology'],"Drawing on cutting-edge science and intimate personal stories, an essential and paradigm-shifting book for readers struggling with fatigue, burnout, stress, and trauma—and for all of us who sometimes feel like we have been pushed past our breaking point. In How We Are, the health psychologist and author Vincent Deary explored the process of habit and change in everyday life. In How We Break, a deeply compassionate and illuminating exploration of suffering, he examines what happens when we are pushed to our limit. Deary is a practitioner health psychologist who also works in a fatigue clinic and specializes in interventions that help people cope with whatever life has thrown at them. The big traumas in life, he points out, are relatively rare. Much more common is when too many things go wrong at once, or we are exposed to a prolonged period of difficulty or precarity. When we are subjected to too much turbulence—when the world shrinks to nothing but our daily coping—we become unhappy, worried, hopeless, exhausted. In other words, we break. Breaking, he shows us, is embodied, as our physical and mental distress are linked, and happens when the same systems that enable us to navigate through life become dysregulated. But if we understand how the turbulence and overwhelm of life affects us, then we have a better chance of overcoming the challenges. Drawing on clinical case studies, trailblazing scientific research, intimate personal stories, and illuminating references from philosophy, literature, and film, How We Break offers a consoling and deeply felt new vision of everyday human struggling, and it makes a bold case for the power of rest and recuperation.",N/A,N/A

Willpower Doesn't Work,['Benjamin Hardy'],2019-12-29,['Behavior modification'],"'Benjamin Hardy is one of the leading voices on well-being and productivity. Willpower Doesn't Work is an insightful guide to help us thrive in today's world' Arianna Huffington If you're relying on willpower alone to help you lose weight, improve your relationships or achieve more at work, you're doomed to fail. The environment around us is far too powerful, stimulating, addicting and stressful to overcome it through sheer determination. Willpower, grit, being positive - basically, all the tools you've been told are the keys to creating lasting change in your life - are insufficient in this high-paced, information-overloaded world we live in. The only way to stop just surviving and learn to truly thrive in today's world is to proactively shape your environment. That's the premise of Willpower Doesn't Work, by organisational psychologist and Medium's most-read self-help guru Benjamin Hardy. Building on copious existing research, as well as his own experience of growing up in a broken family afflicted by addiction and drug use, Hardy explains how people can change their lives on every level by making small, impactful changes in their environment like: * Creating 'enriched environments' - using tougher challenges and self-imposed deadlines to force yourself to rise to the occasion. * Growing into your goals - using radical personal accountability to keep yourself on target and on track. * Becoming the teacher - stepping into a leadership role (even before you think you're ready) to accelerate your skills. * Rotating your environments - getting out of your rut by literally changing your physical surroundings throughout the day or week. From simple steps like removing things that conflict with your values from your environment (like junk food, junk media, even junk people), to incorporating new tools (like fasting or adding 'positive triggers' to your world), these lessons make it possible to consciously shape your surroundings so you can lead a more productive and happier life. Hardy leans on his own story of making the decision to foster three young children to illustrate how any shift, no matter how huge, can become 'the new normal' if you support that change with a productive environment.",N/A,N/A

The Sociolinguistics of Written Identity,['John S. Schmit'],2022-09-15,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"This book examines the ways in which a writer’s presentation of self can achieve or impede access to power. Conversations about written voice and style have traditionally revolved around the aesthetics of stylistic choice. These choices, while they help establish a writer’s presence in a text, too often ignore the needs of written identity as it crosses genres, disciplines, and rhetorical purposes. In contrast to stylistic investigations of a writer’s ""voice"" and its various components—diction, detail, imagery, syntax, and tone, for example—this book focuses on language variation and the linguistic features of a writer’s presence in a text, as well as the establishment of a writer’s social, cultural, and personal identity in a given text. The author attempts to explain the methods by which writers present themselves to their audiences.

Philosophy and Autobiography,['Christopher Hamilton'],2021-11-13,['Philosophy'],"This book, taking its point of departure from Stanley Cavell’s claim that philosophy and autobiography are dimensions of each other, aims to explore some of the relations between these forms of reflection, first by seeking to develop an outline of a philosophy of autobiography, and then by exploring the issue from the side of five autobiographical works. Christopher Hamilton argues in the volume that there are good reasons for thinking that philosophical texts can be considered autobiographical, and then turns to discuss the autobiographies of Walter Benjamin, Peter Weiss, Jean-Paul Sartre, George Orwell, Edmund Gosse and Albert Camus. In discussing these works, Hamilton explores how they put into question certain received understandings of what philosophical texts suppose themselves to be doing, and also how they themselves constitute philosophical explorations of certain key issues, e.g. the self, death, religious and ethical consciousness, sensuality, the body. Throughout, there is an exploration of the ways in which autobiographies help us in thinking about self-knowledge and knowledge of others. A final chapter raises some issues concerning the fact that the five autobiographies discussed here are all texts dealing with childhood.",N/A,N/A

Contemporary Masculinities,['Brendan Gough'],2018-04-19,['Social Science'],"This book assesses the construction of masculinities in relation to appearance, embodiment and emotions by drawing on perspectives in psychology, sociology, gender studies and public health. Brendan Gough questions conventional assumptions about masculinity and men’s health and responds to recent trends in critical studies of masculinities which discuss ‘positive’ or ‘healthy’ masculine identities. The book showcases discursively inflected qualitative research using data sources where men’s own accounts are prioritised: in-depth interviews and online discussion forums. Chapters discuss men’s appearance concerns and activities and examine male mental health, focusing on vulnerability and its management. Current trends and key concepts, including intersectionality, inequalities and embodiment are also considered throughout. This book will appeal to students and academics within social sciences and humanities interested in gender issues in general and masculinity in particular.",N/A,N/A

Narratives,"['T. L. Brink', 'Terry L. Brink']",2022,['Psychology'],"Humans are emotional beings who feel deeply, reason occasionally, and narrate constantly. Narratives are the stories we tell ourselves to help us understand what we are feeling, thinking, and doing. Narratives help us remember the past, interpret the present, and prepare for the future. Narratives justify ourselves, to ourselves and to others. Narratives can motivate our successes, or be used to excuse our failures. To change our lives, we must change our narratives. This book should not be regarded as a rejection of traditional religion, classical philosophy, psychoanalysis, behaviorism, humanistic psychology, or cognitive science. These are the milestones of humanity's attempts to understand human nature. We accept these as the building blocks for a more complete formulation. The first chapter explains what narratives are, and why all narratives are not equal (and some are even dead ends). The second chapter focuses on the most important thing in the study of humans (their values) and why we must distinguish between the ultimate, the utilitarian, and the ulterior dimensions of relevance. The third chapter reviews the role of religious narratives in understanding those values (historically, and in the present; in society, and in individuals). The fourth chapter considers classical philosophy, especially logic, and how this contributes to narratives (but cannot always save us from the dead-end narratives of conspiracy theory and determinism). The fifth chapter charts the historical development of psychology as a science (from mind, to behavior, to mental processes, to narrative and willpower). The sixth chapter looks at the lifespan, and how narratives develop as we confront the challenges posed by our changing relationships. The seventh chapter goes into greater depth on the interacting roles of adulthood: spousal, parent, career, consumer. The last chapter emphasizes the need for resilience and transformation in order to flourish and find flow in those roles.",N/A,N/A

Those Who Come After,['Stephen Frosh'],2019-04-26,['Psychology'],"This book explores the legacies of suffering in relation to ‘those who come after’ – the descendants of victims, survivors and perpetrators of traumatic events. It draws on recent discussions of ‘postmemory’ and ‘haunting’ that are concerned mainly with the transgenerational impact of personal and social trauma. It examines how we are connected to past events for which we have no direct responsibility yet in which we might in some way be ‘implicated’ and it asks how we might attain a position of active witnessing that helps resolve the suffering of others. Those Who Come After includes vivid accounts of witnessing from a variety of perspectives, ranging from Biblical and Jewish stories to contemporary art and music. The book draws on psychosocial studies and psychoanalysis to help make sense of this material and to develop an understanding of acknowledgment and responsibility that is both ethical and emancipatory. Those Who Come After will be of great interest to readers in psychosocial studies and psychoanalysis and to all who are concerned with the question of how to put past suffering to rest.",N/A,N/A
The Illusion of Money,['Kyle Cease'],2022-08-16,['Money'],"New York Times best-selling author and comedian-turned-motivational speaker, Kyle Cease, shows how your obsession with money is actually preventing you from living the life of your dreams. ""I can't afford that."" ""Now's not the right time . . . I need to save up."" ""Quit my job? Are you nuts?!"" Sound familiar? Money is one of the biggest excuses we make to not go after what we really want. Our fixation with money--the desire for more of it, and the fear of not having enough of it--is often really just a longing to feel safe. But this obsession with money is coming at a much bigger cost: our sanity, our creativity, our freedom, and our ability to step into our true power. This book is about eliminating the need to seek safety through the illusion of money, and learning to see ourselves for the perfection that we are--so that we can bring our gifts to the world in an authentic way, and allow ourselves to receive massive, true abundance as a result. Kyle Cease has heard excuses like the ones above countless times at his live events, and he has shown people how to completely break through them. In The Illusion of Money, he shares his own experiences as well as practical tools to help readers understand their ingrained beliefs and attachments to money, and how they can tap into our infinite assets and talents. ""After 25 years as a successful comedian, actor, transformational speaker, author and junior-league amateur bowler, I've experienced many times how chasing money is not an effective way to create an abundant and fulfilling life. The most alive I've ever felt was after I left my comedy career at its peak to become a transformational speaker. I left tons of guaranteed money and so-called security for a complete unknown. It was terrifying--but what was on the other side of that terror was a completely different life that is not only more abundant financially, but has more freedom, more ease, more passion, more impact and more joy."" -- Kyle Cease",N/A,N/A

#Struggles - Study Guide - Following Jesus in a Selfie-Centered World,['Craig Groeschel'],2015-10-27,['Christian life'],"We all love the benefits of technology and social media, but even with the incredible upsides, many of us suspect there are unintended negative consequences beyond our control. The more we compare ourselves with others, the less satisfied we are. The more we interact online, the more we crave face-to-face intimacy. The more filtered our lives become, the more challenging it is for us to be authentic. The more information we receive about the pain and crises in the world, the more difficult it is for us to care. In this timely five-session video-based study (DVD/digital video sold separately), New York Times bestselling author Craig Groeschel taps in to some of the most up-to-date studies on social media to help us understand how it affects our emotions, our relationships, our attitudes, and our beliefs. He offers real-life examples to reveal the depths to which each of us battles with social media, how it masks our real struggles, and how we can reclaim a Christ-centered life. He encourages us to regain control over our lives by rediscovering the principles real life with Jesus brings: contentment, intimacy, authenticity, compassion, and rest. #Struggles will show you the ways technology has enslaved you rather than served you and what changes your need to make in your life to restore balance. Above all, it will point you to Christ and help you understand the healing he wants to do in you. As you follow his leading and seek him first, you will find you are no longer defined by who follows you but by the One you follow.

Identity and the Difficulty of Emancipation,['Volker Kaul'],2021-08-26,['Philosophy'],"This book provides a comprehensive account of the phenomenon of identity in politics, featuring for the first time the question of individual emancipation. It addresses the burning questions of our times, viz. nationalism, populism, Islamic fundamentalism, multiculturalism, postsecularism and postcolonialism. The volume repudiates an easy reconciliation between identity and emancipation, such as it occurs in contemporary liberal and multicultural political theories. It shows that we cannot achieve emancipation without Kant’s help, whereas identity relentlessly draws us back to collective values and the community. The book urges for a new understanding of identity and a politics that instead of accommodating identities seeks to govern them. Identity is the buzzword in the humanities and social sciences, but also the most contentious and least conceptualized term. This book intends to bring theoretical clarity into the debate on how identity plays out in politics.",N/A,N/A

Dowsing Wisdom: Change Direction... Change Your Life,['Helen Sladden'],2019-12-14,['Self-Help'],"Have you ever been told that you already have the answers you seek to the questions you ask and that they are actually inside you? Then, when you ask where to look and how to access them, you get vague or unsatisfying answers about tuning in, meditating, or getting grounded. We are then told to trust our intuition, and go with the feelings, and again feel lost as to what this means. The book Dowsing Wisdom presents an opportunity for not only finding those answers but learning how to listen to your inner voice and develop your intuition while doing it. To Dowse, actually means to search, and is an ancient form of tapping into energy shifts with simple devices like pendulums, dangling pendants or dowsing rods. By using these instruments they present a visual and external display of changing energy frequencies. Internally these would come from your intuition or inner voice if you knew how to listen. The easy to follow instructions on pendulum use, will bring greater awareness of your surroundings and place in the Universe. Using the pendulum will also show how simple 'yes' and 'no' answers have their own distinct vibrational frequency. As your intellectual or conscious mind accepts the visual created by the different pendulum movements, you will notice certain body sensations repeating themselves. It is the awareness of these physical prompts that leads to being able to trust and fine tune your inner voice and intuition. Once you are comfortable using the pendulum, the book further presents potential answers to those frustrating life questions in the Resources section of Channeled work. These chapters answer questions such as: What was the lesson I needed to learn?, or Why is this happening again? What do I really believe, or what is the obstacle holding me from succeeding? Sometimes we also need a cheerleader to get us moving, so the section on motivators for setting goals might help. If we are really stuck then the Categories chapter offers suggestions on where to begin. These resources of 101 Life Lessons, 101 Core Beliefs, 25 Categories can also highlight the blocked emotions which can hold a person hostage, define a resistance to change or alert us to the basis of our fears and phobias. This book is neither diagnostic nor definitive, but merely offers different perspectives as the pendulum swings, to get to know ourselves better, and possibly release pent up frustration as life begins to make a little more sense. The Channeled chapters were presented to this author in response to her work in mentoring and counseling, when she asked the Universe how to dig deeper to help her clients. Sometimes the simplest explanation brings the greatest answers and relief. Enjoy the interesting and rewarding journey of self discovery.",N/A,N/A

Yet, Sophia's and Chiron's books are quite different from one another, even while targeting similar topics, with Sophia adding appropriate material taught to her by many Masters over the past decades. This book describes the invisible dimensions that our consciousness can find itself in, and the beings we might discover there, and is laid out in a structured and easy-to-read format. What is the nature of consciousness? How does it operate, both in the human world and the unseen universe beyond? The hidden realms of consciousness are delved into, and that which exists beyond our current understanding of mind and matter. What can our consciousness do there?What is the structure of the universe, and who are its inhabitants such as our soul, the gods, angels, ghosts, aliens? How can we connect with these invisible beings? Where do they live, and what kind of life do they lead? How can our consciousness astral travel to visit these hidden places? Where are Heaven and Hell? What happens when we die? What are the reasons why our life might be ended? Can we reincarnate, and have we had past lives? The main mission for humans at this present time is to evolve our human consciousness into god consciousness and to live as gods. How do we do this? What is expected of us? How can we discover and design our rightful destiny? How can we learn to manifest things and heal like the gods? The magical tools of our consciousness are explained in detail.Our planet, too, is being prepared to shift into a new dimension.

Veterans and Non-veterans with Schizophrenia,['Ruth L. Firmin'],2013,"['Depression, Mental']","This study investigates differences between veterans and non-veterans with severe mental illness (SMI) regarding perceptions of their illness, themselves, and treatment. I compare patient interviews (using the Indiana Psychiatric Illness Interview, IPII) of Veterans (N=20) and non-Veterans (N=26). Modified grounded theory and qualitative coding software Atlas-TI were used to develop codebooks for each group, and these were compared for differences. I examined differences in both code frequency and meaning. Statistically, more Veterans were male, employed, married, had higher income, and had higher education. Statistical differences in code frequency included: more veterans discussing boredom, regret/guilt/loss, and wanting to be ""normal."" More non-veterans had codes of pessimism and religion/spirituality, wanting a different future, bringing up mental health, family, future: no change, life goals, and relapse. Key differences in narrative themes included: (1) veterans' ""military mindset""/discussion of anger as part of mental illness, (2) non-veterans' focus on mental-illness, (3) differing attitudes regarding stigma, (4) active versus passive attitudes toward treatment, and (5) degree of optimism regarding the future. Differences are described and then potential relationships and interactions are proposed. Veterans appear to have several protective factors (i.e., finances, employment, marriage). Additionally, veterans' military-mindset seems to encourage greater stigma-resistance, and thereby also facilitate veterans being more active and optimistic toward treatment and recovery. By contrast, non-veteran focus on mental illness may be related to increased self-stigma, passive and pessimistic attitudes. I propose that veteran identity can serve as an additional protective factor against stigma, pessimism, and passivity. Veteran-identity may also be a useful framework clinically, to help promote active approaches to treatment (e.g., ""fighting symptoms""). Further, veterans emphasized issues relating to anger as important and part of their mental health. It may be that veterans are more comfortable discussing mental health in the language of ""anger,"" given stigma. Finally, findings suggest that helping individuals in both groups engage in meaningful, non-mental illness-related life activities may help shape self-perception, and thereby responses to stigma, attitudes toward treatment, and hope for the future.",N/A,N/A
Wellbeing and Aspirational Culture,['Kevin Moore'],2019-04-11,['Psychology'],"This book addresses the paradox that, despite quantifiable advances, people often struggle to experience positive wellbeing. Kevin Moore argues that two key insights can help resolve this paradox: first, that we live in an ‘aspirational culture’ that has its roots in the agrarian revolution and now demands constant economic growth, individual ambition, and self-improvement while promoting change and uncertainty; and second, that we are persons, and persons are created when cultures interact with our biology. Accordingly, our wellbeing depends on how personhood develops through that interaction. Bringing together wellbeing and personhood research from multiple disciplines, Moore explains how aspirational cultures are detrimental to wellbeing because they consistently undermine and disrupt the ordinary tasks of life that are essential to sustaining our personhood and wellbeing. He concludes that if we are serious about improving wellbeing, we have to create a culture not based on aspiration but which, instead, focuses on supporting persons and personhood.",N/A,N/A

The book’s primary thesis is that violence is inescapably intertwined with morality and typically enacted for “moral” reasons. To show this, the book compellingly demonstrates how morality operates to trigger and justify violence and how people, in their violent behaviors, can engage and disengage with discrete moralities. The author’s fundamental account of language, and in particular its normative aspects, is particularly insightful as regards extending the range of what is to be understood as violence beyond the domain of physical harm. By employing concepts such as “coalition enforcement”, “moral bubbles”, “cognitive niches”, “overmoralization”, “military intelligence” and so on, the book aims to spell out how perpetrators and victims of violence systematically disagree about the very nature of violence. The author’s original claim is that disagreement can be understood naturalistically, described by an account of morality informed by evolutionary perspectives as well. This book might help us come to terms with the fact that we are intrinsically “violent beings”. To acknowledge this condition, and our stupefying capacity to inflict harm, is a responsibility we must face up to: such understanding could ultimately be of help in order to achieve a safer ownership of our destinies, by individuating and reinforcing those cognitive firewalls that would prevent violence from always escalating and overflowing.",N/A,N/A
The Two Million-Year-Old Self,['Anthony Stevens'],1993,['History'],"Also available in an open-access, full-text edition at http: //oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/85768 With the evolution of human consciousness, nature has finally become conscious of itself. It has taken eons of time, this lumbering progress through the minds of reptiles, mammals, and primates, and it is still working its purpose out in the archetypes of the collective unconscious encoded in the most ancient parts of the human brain. The recent evolutionary history of our species, which Jung personified as ""the two million-year-old human being in us all,"" is still active in our dreams, myths, psychiatric symptoms, traditional healing practices, and typical patterns of behavior. And it is still struggling to help us survive in the often alienating conditions of the modern world. Through a wide-ranging review of developments in anthropology, ethology, sociobiology, neuroscience, psycholinguistics, and Jungian psychology, Anthony Stevens explores the nature of the two million-year-old Self and examines ways in which the contemporary world both fulfills and frustrates its basic needs and intentions. Drawing on his experience as an analyst, Stevens evokes dreams and psychiatry to reveal a compelling and challenging view of the two million-year-old Self as embodying no less than the will of nature, providing ancient wisdom that we neglect at our collective peril. By granting close attention to nature's mind, Stevens argues, we not only further personal wholeness but help redress the gross imbalances of our culture, which are threatening the destruction of the earth. For the ecologically concerned, this book offers a dramatic new perspective on our future relations with our planet.",4,N/A

Lifelong Learning and Dementia,"['Jocey Quinn', 'Claudia Blandon']",2020-03-22,['Education'],"This book explores the potential for lifelong learning in dementia. A growing social issue, dementia has previously been understood as a wasteland for learning: at best, those with dementia are helped to hold on to some pre-existing skills. This book draws on extensive qualitative data with people with dementia and their families to demonstrate that new forms of learning can happen in dementia, with positive outcomes for both the learner and those around them. In doing so, this book demonstrates that those with dementia help us to understand learning differently, thus providing a breakthrough in our understanding and theorising of lifelong learning. Using posthuman theory to scaffold and discuss the findings, this pioneering book will appeal to scholars of dementia, lifelong learning and the posthuman.",N/A,N/A
The Origin of Life Patterns,['Alan Rayner'],2017-03-30,['Psychology'],"Understanding the relationship between human cultural psychology and the evolutionary ecology of living systems is currently limited by abstract perceptions of space and boundaries as sources of definitive discontinuity. This Brief explores the new understandings possible when space and boundaries are perceived instead as sources of receptive continuity and dynamic distinction between local identities and phenomena. It aims to identify the recurrent patterns in which life is expressed over diverse scales in natural ecosystems and to explore how a new awareness of their evolutionary origin in the natural inclusion of space in flux can be related to human cultural psychology. It explains why these patterns cannot adequately be represented or understood in terms of conventional logic and language that definitively isolates the material content from the spatial context of natural systems. Correspondingly, the Brief discusses how the perception of natural space as an infinite, intangible, receptive presence, and of natural informational boundaries as continuous energetic flux, revolutionizes our understanding of evolutionary processes. The mutual natural inclusion of receptive space and informative flux in all distinguishable local phenomena enables evolutionary diversification to be understood as a fluid dynamic exploration of renewing possibility, not an eliminative ‘survival of the fittest’. Self-identity is recognized to be a dynamic inclusion of natural neighborhood, not a definitive exception from neighborhood. The Origins of Life Patterns will be of interest to psychologists, philosophers, anthropologists, evolutionary biologists, ecologists, mathematicians, and physicists.",N/A,N/A
