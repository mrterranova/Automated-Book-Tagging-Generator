Dual-Process Theories in Moral Psychology,['Cordula Brand'],2016-03-21,['Philosophy'],"This anthology offers a unique collection of contributions focusing on the discussion about the so-called dual-process theories within the field of moral psychology. In general, dual-process theories state that in cognitive systems, two sorts of processes can be differentiated: an affective, associative process and an analytical, rule-based process. This distinction recently entered the debate on the relationship between intuitive and rational approaches to explaining the phenomenon of moral judgment. The increasing interest in these theories raises questions concerning their general impact on social contexts. The anthology aims at presenting stepping-stones of an analysis of the merits and drawbacks of this development. For that purpose, the authors discuss general questions concerning the relationship between ethics and empirical sciences, methodological questions, reassessments of established terminology and societal implications of dual-process theories in moral psychology.",5,N/A
Reasons Without Persons,['Brian Hedden'],2015,['Philosophy'],"Brian Hedden defends a radical view about rationality, personal identity, and time. He argues that what it is rational to do should not depend on your past beliefs or actions, which are not part of your current perspective on the world. His impersonal approach holds that what rationality demands of you is solely determined by your evidence.",N/A,N/A
Constructing the Self in a Mediated World,"['Debra Grodin', 'Thomas R. Lindlof']",1996-01-18,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"In today′s media-saturated world, identities are no longer built solely within the close-knit communities of family, neighborhood, school, and work. Today media are part of our world and therefore play an important role in the formulations of our identities or constructions of self. In a truly postmodern mode, Constructing the Self in a Mediated World not only brings together the usually segregated areas of interpersonal and mass communication but also incorporates works from scholars in sociology, psychology, and women′s studies as well. Each essay examines our understanding of self in a different context of mediated culture within a specific framework of interpretive theories such as critical theory, social constructionist theory, and feminism. This volume provides insights into issues of self and identity in contemporary mediated culture. Designed for advanced students and experienced researchers in communication (both media and interpersonal), sociology, psychology, and women′s studies. Constructing the Self in a Mediated World raises important questions and contributes greatly to its field.",N/A,N/A
Revisiting the Use of Self,['Deena Mandell'],2007,['Political Science'],"In recent years, several developments have stimulated new ways of thinking about the social worker's """"self"""" or """"selves"""" in all aspects of practice. The focus on practice with diverse populations, and the emphasis on """"anti-oppressive"""" practice have highlighted elements of the relationship between social worker and client. The objective of this book is threefold: 1. Offer the reader a historical/developmental overview of the concept of """"use of self"""" and critically explore its adequacy for contemporary ethical practice. 2. Provide the reader with first-person, practitioners' accounts of their own """"use of self"""" in examples of reflective practice approaches. 3. Broaden the scope of the concept of critical """"use of self"""" to fields of service where it is under-theorized in, for example, community work and corrections.",N/A,N/A

Remembering the Falklands War,['Sarah Maltby'],2016-06-23,['History'],"This book offers an empirically informed understanding of how identity and agency become wholly embedded within practices of media-remembering. It draws upon data collected from the British military, the BBC and Falkland Islanders during the 30th Anniversary of the Falklands war to uniquely offer multiple perspectives on a single ‘remembering’ phenomenon. The study offers an analysis of the convergence, interconnectedness and interdependence of media and remembering, specifically the production, interpretation and negotiation of remembering in the media ecology. In so doing it not only examines the role of media in the formation and sustaining of collective memory but also the ways those who remember or are remembered in media texts become implicated in these processes.",N/A,N/A

Psychotherapy and the Grandiose Patient,['E. Mark Stern'],1989,['Psychology'],"Here is a practical and thorough volume for any mental health professional who is working with grandiose clients. Using helpful background information and vignettes from clinical contact with their own clients, a number of psychotherapists provide new and enlightening insights into the person who displays an exaggerated sense of self-importance, a constant need for attention and admiration, a sense of entitlement, and an inability to identify and experience how others feel. Learn all about the theoretical basis of grandiosity, the functional and dysfunctional aspects of grandiosity, the possible etiological bases for the onset and maintenance of grandiosity in behavior and attitude, and the sources and consequences of grandiosity in psychotherapists, especially in interaction with grandiosity in patients. You will also better understand the relationship between grandiosity and narcissim, and the relationship between grandiosity and alcoholism, including suggestions for treating alcoholics who display grandiosity.",N/A,N/A
Ego Psychology and Social Work Practice,['Eda Goldstein'],1995-03,['Medical'],"While ego psychological theory still holds a pre-eminent position in clinical social work practice, the field has changed in many ways.

Moral Certainty and the Foundations of Morality,"[""Neil O'Hara""]",2018-03-15,['Philosophy'],"What lies at the foundation of our moral beliefs? If we dig down far enough do we find that our moral values have no ground at all to stand on, and so are apt to collapse upon serious philosophical investigation? This book seeks to answer these and related questions by positing an indubitable foundation for our moral beliefs – they arise from the phenomenon of ‘primary recognition’, and are fundamentally shaped by ‘basic moral certainties’. Drawing on philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Knud Ejler Løgstrup, this book draws together insights from both Analytic and Continental philosophy to provide a convincing new picture of our moral foundations. And it does so in a way that eschews moral conservativism and opens the way for a rich understanding of the variety and particularity of our human moral systems, while also keeping a significant place for those moral beliefs that occur universally, across cultures.",N/A,N/A
Contemporary Masculinities,['Brendan Gough'],2018-04-19,['Social Science'],"This book assesses the construction of masculinities in relation to appearance, embodiment and emotions by drawing on perspectives in psychology, sociology, gender studies and public health. Brendan Gough questions conventional assumptions about masculinity and men’s health and responds to recent trends in critical studies of masculinities which discuss ‘positive’ or ‘healthy’ masculine identities. The book showcases discursively inflected qualitative research using data sources where men’s own accounts are prioritised: in-depth interviews and online discussion forums. Chapters discuss men’s appearance concerns and activities and examine male mental health, focusing on vulnerability and its management. Current trends and key concepts, including intersectionality, inequalities and embodiment are also considered throughout. This book will appeal to students and academics within social sciences and humanities interested in gender issues in general and masculinity in particular.",N/A,N/A
Self-Determination Theory and Healthy Aging,"['Betsy Ng', 'Gloria Ho']",2020-10-20,['Family & Relationships'],"This book pioneers evidence-based research on healthy aging through the application of self determination theory (SDT). Its uniqueness is located in the fact that to date, no other work has applied SDT to the empirical study of aging populations. The authors focus on how SDT drives healthy, successful and active aging, and note that the motivation factors underpinning healthy aging are often neglected, or altogether absent, in the existing literature. This edited volume is particularly timely given the expanding aging crisis in many North American, European and Asian contexts. The collection of chapters meets this challenge head-on in comparing these contexts vis-a-vis a broad international scope, and subsequent discussions on important specialty issues in aging, such as hearing and memory loss. The work offers global perspectives on aging, autonomy and associated life challenges, as well as factors relating to the sustainability of healthy aging in terms of physical and mental well-being. This book will be highly relevant to researchers in the SDT community, as well as specialists in aging and gerontology. It will also be of interest to lifespan psychologists and developmental psychologists.",N/A,N/A
Confronting the Existential Threat of Dementia,"['Richard Cheston', 'Gary Christopher']",2019-06-12,['Psychology'],"This book explores how dementia acts as an existential threat, both to people diagnosed with the condition, and to their carers. The authors highlight how dementia not only gradually erodes our most fundamental abilities, but that it does so at a time of life when the resources of individuals, couples, and families are already stretched. While over time many people who are living with dementia are able to adapt to their diagnosis and acknowledge its impact on them, for many others it remains too threatening and painful to do this. The book draws on examples from clinical practice and experimental studies to argue that a range of responses, such as searching for long-dead parents or clinging to previous identities, all represent ways in which people living with dementia attempt to protect themselves against the emotional impact of the condition. Finally, the authors set out new ways of intervening to boost psychological resources and thereby support people in facing the existential threat of dementia.",N/A,N/A

Male Eating Disorders,['Russell Delderfield'],2018-12-05,['Social Science'],"This book takes a novel approach to the study of male eating disorders – an area that is often dominated by clinical discourses. The study of eating disorders in men has purportedly suffered from a lack of dedicated attention to personal and socio-cultural aspects. Delderfield tackles this deficiency by spotlighting a set of personal accounts written by a group of men who have experiences of disordered eating. The text presents critical interpretations that aim to situate these experiences in the social and cultural context in which these disorders occur. This discursive work is underpinned by an eclectic scholarly engagement with social psychology and sociology literature around masculinities, embodiment and fatness, belonging, punishment, stigma, and control; leading to understandings about relationships with food, body and self. This is undertaken with a reflexive element, as the personal intersects with the professional. This text will appeal to students, scholars and clinicians in social sciences, humanities, and healthcare studies, including public health.",N/A,N/A

The Oxford Handbook of Hypo-egoic Phenomena,"['Kirk Warren Brown', 'Mark R. Leary']",2017,['Philosophy'],"Egoicism, a mindset that places primary focus upon oneself, is rampant in contemporary Western cultures as commercial advertisements, popular books, song lyrics, and mobile apps consistently promote self-interest. Consequently, researchers have begun to address the psychological, interpersonal, and broader societal costs of excessive egoicism and to investigate alternatives to a ""me and mine first"" mindset. For centuries, scholars, spiritual leaders, and social activists have advocated a ""hypo-egoic"" way of being that is characterized by less self-concern in favor of a more inclusive ""we first"" mode of functioning. In recent years, investigations of hypo-egoic functioning have been examined by psychologists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and philosophers. Edited by Kirk Warren Brown and Mark R. Leary, The Oxford Handbook of Hypo-egoic Phenomena brings together an expert group of contributors to examine these groundbreaking lines of inquiry, distilling current knowledge about hypo-egoicism into an exceptional resource. In this volume, readers will fi nd theoretical perspectives from philosophy and several major branches of psychology to inform our understanding of the nature of hypo-egoicism and its expressions in various domains of life. Further, readers will encounter psychological research discoveries about particular phenomena in which hypo-egoicism is a prominent feature, demonstrating its implications for well-being, regulation of emotion, adaptive decision-making, positive social relations, and other markers of human happiness, well-being, and health. This Handbook offers the most comprehensive and thoughtful analyses of hypo-egoicism to date.",N/A,N/A
Phenomenology of Suicide,['Maurizio Pompili'],2017-10-10,['Medical'],"This book will help the reader to understand the suicidal mind from a phenomenological point of view, shedding light on the feelings of suicidal individuals and also those of clinicians. In accordance with the importance that the phenomenological approach attaches to subjectivity and sense of self as the starting points for knowledge, emphasis is placed on the need for the clinician to focus on the subjective experiences of the at-risk individual, to set aside prior assumptions, judgments, or interpretations, and to identify ways of bridging gaps in communication associated with negative emotions. The vital importance of empathy is stressed, drawing attention to the insights offered by neuroimaging studies and the role of mirror neurons in social cognition. It is widely acknowledged that when a clinician meets a person who wants to die by suicide, the clinician does not fully understand what is going on inside the mind of that individual. This book recognizes that any approach to suicide prevention must promote understanding of suicidal thoughts and feelings. The awareness that it fosters and the innovative perspectives that it presents will appeal to a wide readership.",N/A,N/A
Identity Structure Analysis and Teacher Mentorship,"['Graham Passmore', 'Amanda Turner', 'Julie Prescott']",2019-11-12,['Education'],"This book examines the benefits of applying the Identity Structure Analysis (ISA) to teacher professional development. At present no government, local authority or school is actively applying Identity Structure Analysis to monitor school improvement: in a profession where turnover is extremely high, ISA is framed as a way for professional development to meet the needs of the specific teacher. Examining idiographic ISA analyses as well as practical advice for implementing professional development programs, the authors scrutinise how ISA can be used in conjunction with mentoring to offset teacher turnover. This practical volume will be of interest and value to scholars and researchers of teacher identity and professional development, as well as researchers and policymakers interested in reducing teacher turnover.",N/A,N/A
Aging and Human Nature,"['Mark Schweda', 'Michael Coors', 'Claudia Bozzaro']",2020-01-11,['Family & Relationships'],"This book focuses on ageing as a topic of philosophical, theological, and historical anthropology. It provides a systematic inventory of fundamental theoretical questions and assumptions involved in the discussion of ageing and old age. What does it mean for human beings to grow old and become more vulnerable and dependent? How can we understand the manifestations of ageing and old age in the human body? How should we interpret the processes of change in the temporal course of a human life? What impact does old age have on the social dimensions of human existence? In order to tackle these questions, the volume brings together internationally distinguished scholars from the fields of philosophy, theology, cultural studies, social gerontology, and ageing studies. The collection of their original articles makes a twofold contribution to contemporary academic discourse. On one hand, it helps to clarify and deepen our understanding of ageing and old age by examining it from the fundamental point of view of philosophical, theological, and historical anthropology. At the same time, it also enhances and expands the discourses of philosophical, theological, and historical anthropology by systematically taking into account that human beings are essentially ageing creatures.",N/A,N/A
Overcoming Polarization in the Public Square,['Lauren Swayne Barthold'],2020-06-22,['Philosophy'],"This book describes how civic dialogue can serve as an antidote to a polarized public square. It argues that when pervasive polarization renders rational and fact-based argumentation ineffective, we first need to engage in a way that builds trust. Civic dialogue is a form of structured discourse that utilizes first-person narratives in order to promote trust, openness, and mutual understanding. By creating a dialogic structure that encourages listening and reflection, particularities and differences about fraught identities can be expressed in such a way that leads to the possibility of connecting through our fundamental, shared, and deeply felt humanity. Drawing on Plato, Buber, Gadamer, Dewey, cognitive bias research, as well as the work of dialogue practitioners, Lauren Swayne Barthold provides a sustained defense of civic dialogue as an effective strategy for avoiding futile political arguments and for creating pluralistic democratic communities.",N/A,N/A
Pride and Authenticity,['Ulrich Steinvorth'],2016-10-01,['Philosophy'],"This book explores the morality of pride, a value that has been condemned through history and is still largely unwelcome in many societies. The author explores the nature of the self and free will, and how pride links to technology and rational theology. It refers to the work of Lionel Trilling, Allan Bloom, Charles Taylor and Heidegger on authenticity; Jacob Burckhardt, Stephen Toulmin, Max Weber and Mark Lilla on modernity; Christine Korsgaard on the self; John Rawls and Ruth Benedict on morality; and the Stoics and Kant on free will.",N/A,N/A
Beyond the Psychology Industry,['Paul Rhodes'],2019-12-10,['Psychology'],"This book provides a scholarly yet accessible approach to critical psychology, specifically discussing therapeutic practices that are possible outside of the mainstream psychology industry. While there are many books that deconstruct or dismantle clinical psychology, few provide a compendium of potential alternatives to mainstream practice. Focusing on five main themes in reference to this objective: suffering, decolonization, dialogue, feminism and the arts, these pages explore types of personal inquiry, cultural knowledge or community action that might help explain and heal psychological pain beyond the confines of the therapy room. Chapters focus on the role of cultural knowledge, including spiritual traditions, relational being, art, poetry, feminism and indigenous systems in promoting healing and on community-based-initiatives, including open dialogue, justice-based collaboration and social prescribing. Beyond the Psychology Industry will be of interest to researchers, clinical psychologists, therapists, academics in mental health, and cultural psychologists.",N/A,N/A
"Self, Value, and Narrative",['Anthony Rudd'],2012-10-25,['Philosophy'],"Anthony Rudd presents a striking new account of the self as an ethical, evaluative being.

Learner Narratives of Translingual Identities,['Patrick Kiernan'],2018-08-16,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"This book addresses translingual identities through an innovative multimodal analysis of the language learning histories of a class of advanced learners of English in Japan who grew up between two or more languages. The author explores both the translingual experiences of those in the classroom and how they use language and gesture when describing their experiences to each other. This approach uses three perspectives: it looks at the worlds and identities the interviewees construct for themselves; at their interpersonal communication; and at the way they frame their experience. Finally, it offers some lessons based on the observations of the class which reveal the values they share and the key to their success as language learners. It will appeal to applied linguistic and educational researchers, particularly those with an interest in narrative approaches to exploring educational contexts, as well as language educators and policy makers interested in gaining a learner perspective on language learning.",N/A,N/A
The Psychology of Justice and Legitimacy,"['D. Ramona Bobocel', 'Aaron C. Kay', 'Mark P. Zanna', 'James M. Olson']",2011-02-25,['Mathematics'],"In response to the international turmoil, violence, and increasing ideological polarization, social psychological interest in the topics of legitimacy and social justice has blossomed considerably.

Medical Identities,['Kent Maynard'],2007,['Business & Economics'],"Illness and misfortune more broadly are ubiquitous; thus, healing roles or professions are also universal. Ironically, however, little attention has been paid to those who heal or promote wellbeing. These come in many different guises: in some societies, healing is highly professional and specialized; in some cases, it is more preventative, in others more interventionist. Based on rich and wide-ranging ethnographic data and especially written for this volume, these essays look at how a great variety of health providers are perceived - from traditional healers to physicians, from diviners to nursing home providers. Conversely, the authors also ask how healers, or those concerned with wider matters of well being, view themselves and to what degree social attitudes differ in regard to who these people are, as well as their power, prestige and activities. As these essays demonstrate, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, or state policy may all play formative roles in shaping the definition of health and wellbeing, how they are delivered, and the character and prestige of those who provide for our health and welfare in society.",N/A,N/A
Sacred Selfishness,['Bud Harris'],2005,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","While growing up, selfishness is defined for most people as a destructive force -- power-driven, self-obsessed, a tyranny against others, and a drain on energy. Early lessons teach that the needs of others must be put above one's own. This has created a culture of outward-directed people, cut off from the inner sources of energy and vitality. Failing to develop one's individuality can eventually lead to depression and ill health. Only after becoming whole can one help others as well as society. This is the lesson of Sacred Selfishness, in which Jungian analyst Bud Harris argues persuasively that one must live authentically in order to be whole, happy, healthy, and a truly contributing member of society. This essential guide offers many strategies readers can use in order to live a ""sacredly selfish"" life, from analyzing dreams to keeping a detailed journal that teaches seekers to understand themselves, their worth, and their needs.",3,N/A
The Study of the Meaning of Life,['Zhengyu Sun'],2024-10-28,['Philosophy'],"Based on the revelation and analysis of the social self-consciousness contained in the individual self-consciousness of the meaning of life, the book discusses the human life-world, spiritual world, cultural world and meaning-world. Then, it states the life-world, modes of thought, values ideas, aesthetic consciousness and ultimate concerns of modern humans. It also systematically expounds on the cultivation, the truth, the nurture, the sublimation, the support, the tension and the source of the spiritual home in perspectives of education, science, art, philosophy, theory, mentality and ideals. Constructing a fulfilling spiritual home for man is the realistic meaning of this book.",N/A,N/A
Body Disownership in Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,['Yochai Ataria'],2018-05-11,['Psychology'],"This book explores the long-term outcomes of severe and ongoing trauma—particularly complex posttraumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD)—from phenomenological and cognitive perspectives. For example, C-PTSD can result in impairments at the body-schema level. In order to survive, trauma victims may conduct their lives at the body-image level, thus producing a mismatch between body schema and body image. In turn, as in the case of somatoparaphrenia and body integrity identity disorder, this incongruity can result in body disownership, which will affect long-term outcomes of severe and ongoing trauma.",N/A,N/A
Humanising Higher Education,"['Camila Devis-Rozental', 'Susanne Clarke']",2020-11-16,['Psychology'],"This book explores humanising practice within higher education (HE). It provides a fresh perspective by bringing together expert voices with empirical experience of humanising theory and practice in various areas of higher education, in order to influence and improve the way in which universities work. The book draws on Todres et. al’s humanisation framework, as well other relevant theories such as positive organisational scholarship, Vygotsky’s socio-cultural theory and socio-emotional intelligence. Topics include micro elements of humanisation such as transitions and the student experience, and macro elements such as the policy impact of humanising HE and sustainability. The authors demonstrate how a humanising approach can provide the catalyst for wider change and help to improve wellbeing in the community. This book offers an invaluable resource for scholars interested in teaching and learning in HE, and for HE practitioners and policy makers keen to develop a more human practice.",N/A,N/A
The Films of Lars von Trier and Philosophy,"['José A. Haro', 'William H.

The book addresses von Trier’s films in order of their release. The earlier chapters discuss his Golden Heart trilogy and USA: Land of Opportunities series by addressing issues of potential misogyny, ethical critique, and racial justice. The later chapters focus on his Depression Trilogy and address the undermining of gender binaries, the psychoanalytic meaning of the sacrifice of children and depression, and philosophical questions provoked by the depiction of the end of the world. Taken together, the volume explores the topics of Philosophical Psychology, Social Theory, Political Theory, Theories of the Self, Philosophy of Race, and Feminist Thought, and opens a conversation about von Trier’s important work.",N/A,N/A
Falling Awake,['Todd L. Blattner'],2016-11-29,['Self-Help'],"Waking is a natural shift from unconsciousness to awareness. Falling awake is a special case of waking where we relax out of old patterns, ease out of resistance, and surrender to the grace and love that are always present beneath the surface of appearances. Although falling awake, like falling asleep, cannot be forced, it can be prepared for. Integrating perspectives from physical, social and psychological sciences, philosophy, religion and energy awareness, and calling on many years of experience as a teacher, counsellor and Buddhist monk, Blattner takes us step by step into an expanded understanding of the universe in which we live, the mind/body system that we call ""self "", and that which may lie beyond. With gentleness and kindness, Falling Awake shows us how to move beyond the programs and limiting belief systems that support the problems in our lives, and awaken into an increasingly gentle, joyful, and expanded experience of the art of living....",N/A,N/A
Beyond Identities: Human Becomings in Weirding Worlds,['Jim Dator'],2022-08-31,['Philosophy'],"This book is an argument for moving beyond culturally/historically/ethnically/biologically-grounded identity as the necessary foundation of an authentic self. It highlights examples of people who are attempting to inhabit identities they feel are more appropriate to themselves, by deploring the damage done via claims about authentic identity. The sole theme of this book is “becoming beyond identity”. We are not fixed human beings but rather perpetually-dynamic human becomings. As intelligence is enabled or recognized beyond the merely human, we should welcome our continuing evolution from homosapiens, sapiens, into many varieties of intelligences on Earth and the cosmos. This book builds from tiny ripples into a tsunami of examples from conventional identity studies, to Confucian human becomings, to apotemnophilia, to DIY biohacking, to cyborgs, to artilects, to hiveminds, to intelligence in animals, plants and fungi from the Holocene through the beginnings of the precarious, climate change-driven Anthropocene Epoch, with hints far beyond and throughout the cosmos. From a lifetime of work in future studies, anticipation science and space studies, the author balances frank tales of his own experiences and beliefs concerning his uncertain and fluid identities with those of others who tell their stories. In addition to material from academic and popular sources, a few poems further illuminate the scene.",N/A,N/A
