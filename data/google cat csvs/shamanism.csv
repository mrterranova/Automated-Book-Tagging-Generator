Tragic Spirits,['Manduhai Buyandelger'],2013-11,['History'],"The collapse of socialism at the end of the twentieth century brought devastating changes to Mongolia. Economic shock therapy—an immediate liberalization of trade and privatization of publicly owned assets—quickly led to impoverishment, especially in rural parts of the country, where Tragic Spirits takes place. Following the travels of the nomadic Buryats, Manduhai Buyandelger tells a story not only of economic devastation but also a remarkable Buryat response to it—the revival of shamanic practices after decades of socialist suppression. Attributing their current misfortunes to returning ancestral spirits who are vengeful over being abandoned under socialism, the Buryats are now at once trying to appease their ancestors and recover the history of their people through shamanic practice. Thoroughly documenting this process, Buyandelger situates it as part of a global phenomenon, comparing the rise of shamanism in liberalized Mongolia to its similar rise in Africa and Indonesia. In doing so, she offers a sophisticated analysis of the way economics, politics, gender, and other factors influence the spirit world and the crucial workings of cultural memory.",N/A,N/A,en

Webb seeks to understand the indigenous Andean concept of yanantin or ""complementary opposites."" One of the most well-known and defining characteristics of indigenous Andean thought, yanantin is an adherence to a philosophical model based on the belief that the polarities of existence (such as male/ female, dark/light, inner/outer) are interdependent and essential parts of a harmonious whole. Webb embarks on a personal journey of understanding the yanantin worldview of complementary duality through participant observation and reflection on her individual experience. Her investigation is a thoughtful, careful, and rich analysis of the variety of ways in which cultures make meaning of the world around them, and how deeply attached we become to our own culturally imposed meaning-making strategies.",N/A,N/A,en

The Body of Myth,['J. Nigro Sansonese'],1994,['Health & Fitness'],"Long ago the ancestors of the Greeks, Romans, and Hindus were one people living on the Eurasian steppes. At the core of their religion was the ""shamanic trance,"" a natural state but one in which consciousness achieves a profound level of inner awareness. Over the course of millennia, the Indo-Europeans divided and migrated into Europe and the Indian subcontinent. The knowledge of shamanic trance retreated from everyday awareness and was carried on in the form of myths and distilled into spiritual practices--most notably in the Indian tradition of yoga. J. Nigro Sansonese compares the myths of Greece as well as those of the Judeo-Christian tradition with the yogic practices of India and concludes that myths are esoteric descriptions of what occurs within the human body, especially the human nervous system, during trance. In this light, the myths provide a detailed map of the shamanic state of consciousness that is our natural heritage. This book carries on from the works of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell to show how the portrayal of consciousness embodied in myth can be extended to a reappraisal of the laws of physics; before they are descriptions of the world, these laws--like myths--are descriptions of the human nervous system.",N/A,N/A,en

Wayward Shamans,['Silvia Tom‡_kov‡'],2013-05-03,['Social Science'],"Wayward Shamans tells the story of an idea that humanityÕs first expression of art, religion and creativity found form in the figure of a proto-priest known as a shaman. Tracing this classic category of the history of anthropology back to the emergence of the term in Siberia, the work follows the trajectory of European knowledge about the continentÕs eastern frontier. The ethnographic record left by German natural historians engaged in the Russian colonial expansion project in the 18th century includes a range of shamanic practitioners, varied by gender and age. Later accounts by exiled Russian revolutionaries noted transgendered shamans. This variation vanished, however, in the translation of shamanism into archaeology theory, where a male sorcerer emerged as the key agent of prehistoric art. More recent efforts to provide a universal shamanic explanation for rock art via South Africa and neurobiology likewise gloss over historical evidence of diversity. By contrast this book argues for recognizing indeterminacy in the categories we use, and reopening them by recalling their complex history.",N/A,N/A,en
Animal and Shaman,['Julian Baldick'],2012-10-22,['History'],"""Animal and Shaman, a comparative study of the indigenous pre-Christian and pre-Muslim religions of Central Asia, describes a common inheritance among the beliefs of the various peoples who have lived in Central Asia or have migrated from there: Scythians, Huns, Mongols, Manchus, Finns and Hungarians."" ""Shamans - holy men and healers among the pagan faiths - relied heavily on animal sacrifices to create spiritual purity and to nourish the soul and, as a result, animals and spirituality were locked in a mutually dependent embrace. Julian Baldick demonstrates that in pagan times there were remarkable common features in the forms of worship and spiritual expression and that these similarities were largely based on the roles of animals in the different cultures of Central Asia. He shows that these have not only survived in the myths and legends of the region but have also found their way into the mythologies of the West.""

This two-volume reference is the first international survey of shamanistic beliefs from prehistory to the present day.

Ecstatic Religion,['I. M. Lewis'],2003,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","First Published in 2004. States of spirit possession, in which believer's feel themselves to be 'possessed' by the deity and raised to a new plane of existence, are found in almost all known religions. From Dionysiac cults to Haitia voodoo, Christian and Sufi mysticism to shamanic ritual, the rapture and frenzy of ecstatic experience forms an iconic expression of faith in all its devastating power and unpredictability. Ecstatic Religion has, since its first appearance in 1971, became the classic investigative study of these phenomena. Exploring the social and political significance of spiritual ecstasy and possession, it concerns the distinct types of functions of mystical experience - in particular, the differences between powerful male-dominated possession cults which reinforce established morality and power, and marginal, renegade ecstatics expressing forms of protest on behalf of the oppressed, especially women. I. M. Lewis's wide-ranging comparative study looks at the psychological, medical, aesthetic, religious and cultural aspects of possession, and covers themes including soul-loss, ecstatic trance, divination, erotic passion and exorcism. Probing the mysteries of spirit possession through the critical lens of anthropological and sociological theory, this fully revised and expanded Third Edition is of crucial importance for students of psychology, sociology, religious mysticism and shamanism.",N/A,N/A,en

Self-published by Nicolar, this is one of the few sustained narratives in English composed by a member of an Eastern Algonquian-speaking people during the nineteenth century.

This extraordinary work weaves together stories of Penobscot history, precontact material culture, feats of shamanism, and ancient prophecies about the coming of the white man.

Singing to the Plants,['Stephan V. Beyer'],2010-06-30,['Health & Fitness'],"In the Upper Amazon, mestizos are the Spanish-speaking descendants of Hispanic colonizers and the indigenous peoples of the jungle. Some mestizos have migrated to Amazon towns and cities, such as Iquitos and Pucallpa; most remain in small villages. They have retained features of a folk Catholicism and traditional Hispanic medicine, and have incorporated much of the religious tradition of the Amazon, especially its healing, sorcery, shamanism, and the use of potent plant hallucinogens, including ayahuasca. The result is a uniquely eclectic shamanist culture that continues to fascinate outsiders with its brilliant visionary art. Ayahuasca shamanism is now part of global culture. Once the terrain of anthropologists, it is now the subject of novels and spiritual memoirs, while ayahuasca shamans perform their healing rituals in Ontario and Wisconsin. Singing to the Plants sets forth just what this shamanism is about--what happens at an ayahuasca healing ceremony, how the apprentice shaman forms a spiritual relationship with the healing plant spirits, how sorcerers inflict the harm that the shaman heals, and the ways that plants are used in healing, love magic, and sorcery.",N/A,N/A,en

One Spirit Medicine,['Alberto Villoldo'],2016-09-27,['Health & Fitness'],"Today our minds, our emotions, our relationships, and our bodies are out of kilter. We know it, but we tend to ignore it until something brings us up short--a worrying diagnosis, a broken relationship, or simply an inability to function harmoniously in everyday life. When things are a little off, we read a self-help book. When they're really bad, we bring in oncologists to address cancer, neurologists to repair the brain, psychologists to help us understand our family of origin. But this fragmented approach to health is merely a stopgap. To truly heal, we need to return to the original recipe for wellness discovered by shamans millennia ago: One Spirit Medicine. Through One Spirit Medicine, the shamans found that they could grow a new body that allowed them to live in extraordinary health. They learned how to switch off the ""death clock"" inside every cell, and turn on the ""immortality"" genes that reside in password-protected regions of our DNA. Cancer, dementia, and heart disease were rare. The shamans of old were truly masters of prevention. Drawing on more than 25 years of experience as a medical anthropologist--as well as his own journey back from the edge of death--acclaimed shamanic teacher Alberto Villoldo shows you how to detoxify the brain and gut with superfoods, use techniques for working with our luminous energy fields to heal your body, and follow the ancient path of the medicine wheel to shed disempowering stories from the past and pave the way for rebirth. Using the principles and practices in this book, you can feel better in a few days, begin to clear your mind and heal your brain in a week, and in six weeks be on your way to a new body--one that heals rapidly, retains its youthful vitality, and keeps you connected to Spirit, to the earth, and to a renewed sense of purpose in your life.",N/A,N/A,en

The Strong Eye of Shamanism,['Robert E. Ryan'],1999,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","An exploration of shamanism and the archetypal symbolism that sits at the foundation of all human life • Not just an academic work. Helps the reader experience the actual mindset of the shaman • Presents a cohesive view of the recurrent patterns of symbolism and visionary experience that underlie all religion The human psyche contains archetypal patterns largely lost to contemporary society but which shamans have employed for over 30,000 years to gain access to the spiritual world. Shamanic symbols both affect and reflect these durative patterns that exist, with uncanny similarity, in civilizations separated by expanses of time and distance. The Strong Eye of Shamanism draws together the many facets of the art of shamanism, presenting a cohesive view of the recurrent patterns of symbolism and visionary experience that underlie its practice. The ""strong eye"" of the title refers to the archetypal symbolism that sits at the foundation of all human life--whether in Paleolithic caves or today's temples. The author asserts that society has become separated from the power of those symbols that lead us into deeper understanding of our spirituality. In today's world of splintered psyches, a world in which people are in search of their souls, shamanism survives as an age-old technology of soul recovery, a living Rosetta stone that reminds us of the shared foundation that exists beneath even the most radically different perspectives. Through its study of shamanism, archetypal psychology, and symbolism, The Strong Eye of Shamanism encourages individuals--and society--to look inward and remember that the deepest forms of awareness begin with the knowledge that the answers reside within us.",5,N/A,en

Religion in Context,['I. M. Lewis'],1996-04-18,['Religion'],"Religious power assumes many strikingly different forms, which are often regarded as unique, unrelated, and even mutually exclusive. Religion in Context, however, adopts a holistic approach and argues that these apparently contradictory mystical experiences are in fact part of a web of mutually defining and sustaining elements. Stressing the importance of rigorous social contextualisation, I. M. Lewis analyses phenomena such as spirit-possession, witchcraft, cannibalism, and shamanism, revealing connections between them and with the world religions. This expanded and updated edition illuminates critical aspects of religious power, and demonstrates the value of a comparative approach to formulating anthropological theory. It will be of value to students of anthropology, religion, and to anyone concerned with the nature of religion in the modern world.",N/A,N/A,en

On the basis of material only available in Danish, and presented herein English for the first time, the author questions Mircea Eliade's well-known definition of the shaman as the master of ecstasy and suggests that his role has to be seen as that of a master of spirits. The ambivalent nature of the shaman and the spirit world in the tough Arctic environment is then contrasted with the more benign attitude to shamanism in the New Age movement. After presenting descriptions of their organizations and accounts by participants, the author critically analyses the role of neo-shamanic courses and concludes that it is doubtful to consider what isoffered as shamanism.",N/A,N/A,en

In covering these diverse areas, the authors depart from the general cultural models usually offered in discussions of shamanism, providing a new vision of 'shamanism' as made up of fragmentary, non-formularized parts.

Shamans in Asia provides an introduction to the study of shamans and six ethnographic studies, each of which describes and analyses the lives and activities of shamans in five different regions: Siberia, China, Korea, and the Ryukyu islands of southern Japan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The essays show what type of people become shamans, what social roles they play, and how shamans actively draw from the worldviews of the communities in which they operate. As the first book in English to provide in-depth accounts of shamans from different regions of Asia, it allows students and scholars to view the diversity and similarities of shamans and their religions.

Spirit Hacking shatters readers' complacency, giving them tools to navigate the tumultuous times in which we find ourselves. We will emerge from this period happier, lighter, and more vibrant than ever before. 'I didn't have any understanding of the spirit world and how much power it could add to my life until I met Shaman Durek. I'm new to all this but with the help of Shaman Durek and Spirit Hacking I've developed a deeper connection to my myself and my personal spiritual path.' - Nina Dobrev, actress and activist 'This guy does next level stuff. I have worked with him and I have no idea how or why he is able to do some of the things I have witnessed. Science is just catching up with biohacking. It's time to start studying spirit hacking and how Shaman Durek can achieve the tangible results he achieves.' - Dave Asprey, author of the New York Times bestseller, The Bulletproof Diet, Silicon Valley investor and technology entrepreneur 'In Spirit Hacking, I was swept away in an exploration of spirituality, quantum physics, neuroscience and the real essence of what it is to be human. Shaman Durek has a unique way of bringing people out of themselves and helping them become their authentic selves.' - Dr Caroline Leaf, cognitive neuroscientist, author of Switch on Your Brain 'Profoundly insightful to the times we're living through, and hugely helpful on how to thrive in their midst - in spite of ourselves. Shaman Durek is a compelling storyteller and he writes exactly as he speaks - casually, potently, and with a brilliantly, calculating sense of humor. He knows what he teaches, and this is absolutely the topic that most needs hacking.' - Mike Dooley, NY Times bestselling author of Infinite Possibilities 'Shaman Durek is a bright light, the kind of light the world desperately needs. His authentic, loving presence allows anyone who is talking to him feel like they are the only one in the room. In a world where we are caught up in the next, he rests in the now. This deep present moment awareness is where Shamen Durek shines.

Shamanism in Siberia,['Andrei Znamenski'],2003-12-31,['History'],"This book takes you to the ""classical academy of shamanism,"" Siberian tribal spirituality that gave birth to the expression ""shamanism."" Popular imagination frequently associates this phenomenon with Native American religions. At the same time, because of the language barrier, a large number of primary sources coming from Siberia, the ""motherland"" of shamanism, have been inaccessible not only to the general reader but also to scholars. For the first time, in this volume Znamenski has rendered in readable English more than one hundred books and articles that describe all aspects of Siberian shamanism: ideology, ritual, mythology, spiritual pantheon, and paraphernalia. The anthology is also supplemented with an extensive interpretive essay, in which Znamenski introduces the reader to shamanism studies and shows how Russian and Western writers and scholars have covered Siberian spirituality from the eighteenth century to the present. Both anthropologists, historians of religion, psychologists and practitioners of shamanism will find in this text plenty of valuable information, which they can use in their research, seminars and workshops.",N/A,N/A,en

Supernatural,['Graham Hancock'],2005,['Archaeoastronomy'],"One of the great mysteries of human history is why humankind, which have evolved anatomically millions of years previously suddenly at around 50, 000 B. C first began to think symbolically, as we see from Stone Age art. In order to investigate this mystery, Graham Hancock journeys first to explore the wonderful cave paintings of Southern France. There he learns the theory of an unorthodox anthropologist that the distinctive features of these paintings - and the similar paintings created by tribesmen in South America - show them to be representations of the successive stages of trance states induced by psychoactive plants. Could it be that the most dramatic evolution in human consciousness was the result of experimentation with drugs? Hancock then goes to live with one of these present day tribes in South America, in order to experiment with psychoactive plants, enter trance states and meet the gods of the tribal elders. At the end of this dangerous experiment, Hancock does indeed encounter the gods of the tribal elders - and begins to see in their lineaments the familiar shapes of the founder gods of Egypt about whom he has written so much. Hancock's historical search shows that in all places and at all times these same entities seem to have appeared to people in this drug-induced trance state. Hancock asks the question, could it be that rather than being mere hallucinations, these entities exist in a parallel dimension, sometimes squeezing through into our own dimension in order to direct the course of human history? Graham Hancock's new book is a groundbreaking new case for the reality of the supernatural. It is in a sense a return to the extremely vivid first person detective story of Hancock's first bestseller 'The Sign and the Seal'. The account of his journeys both real and 'inner' are utterly enthralling.",N/A,N/A,en

Using a mixture of historical documents, mythology, archaeological data, and ethnographic studies of contemporary shamans, she builds a case for shamans being the driving force behind the blossoming of complex societies. More interesting, shamans in East Asia are generally women, who used their access to the spirit world to take leadership roles.

Reindeer People,['Piers Vitebsky'],2005,['Fiction'],"A voyage of discovery into the life of a remote aboriginal community in the Siberian Arctic, where the reindeer has been a part of daily life since Palaeolithic times. The reindeer, along with the dog, was probably the first species to be drawn into a close relationship with man. This book, by an eminent British anthropologist, is the beautifully written story of how that relationship works and of the intimacy between the nomadic reindeer people and the landscape they inhabit. What to the Western eye looks like a vast, uninhabited Arctic wilderness is in fact filled with animals, humans and spirits -- and the memory-traces of their interactions down the ages. to these distant regions of the Siberian taiga. Living and travelling with the reindeer people over a period of a dozen years, Piers Vitebsky has seen how, first, Communism and collectivization threatened the way of life of the nomadic tribesmen, and then the marketplace continued to transform their existence. Through all the changes of the late 20th century the reindeer has retained its central place in the physical and spiritual life of the people (Siberia is considered to be the original heartland of shamanism.) The book is also a celebration of human love at an elemental level.",N/A,N/A,en

Shamanism and the Eighteenth Century,['Gloria Flaherty'],1992,['Europe'],"Pursuing special experiences that take them to the brink of permanent madness or death, men and women in every age have ""returned"" to heal and comfort their fellow human beings--and these shamans have fascinated students of society from Herodotus to Mircea Eliade. Gloria Flaherty's book is about the first Western encounters with shamanic peoples and practices. Flaherty makes us see the eighteenth century as an age in which explorers were fascinating all Europe with tales of shamans who accomplished a ""self-induced cure for a self-induced fit."" Reports from what must have seemed a forbidden world of strange rites and moral licentiousness came from botanists, geographers, missionaries, and other travelers of the period, and these accounts created such a stir that they permeated caf talk, journal articles, and learned debates, giving rise to plays, encyclopedia articles, art, and operas about shamanism. The first part of the book describes in rich detail how information about shamanism entered the intellectual mainstream of the eighteenth century. In the second part Flaherty analyzes the artistic and critical implications of that process. In so doing, she offers remarkable chapters on Diderot, Herder, Goethe, and the cult of the genius of Mozart, as well as a chapter devoted to a new reading of Goethe's Faust that views Faust as the modern shaman.

Portals of Power,"['E. Jean Matteson Langdon', 'Gerhard Baer']",1992,['Medical'],"Shamans and their practices have fascinated Western civilization since publication of the earliest ethnographies. Yet, alien to a positivistic worldview and characterized by hysteria, ecstasy, and magic, shamanism has continued to be classified as vestigial or archaic long after such labels have become meaningless. Lately, a fresh approach has emerged that rejects arbitrary definition in favor of symbolic analysis and native interpretation. Portals of Power explores this new perspective. Researchers from South America, Europe, and the United States examine shamanism in twelve South American societies. In considering such aspects as visionary experience, native conceptions of power, ritual efficacy, expressive culture, and response to change, contributors to this volume present shamanism as an enduring cultural form, rather than an archaic religion. This is a work that transcends debates about ""true"" shamanism, to present a global view of shamanism as a dynamic aspect of culture.",N/A,N/A,en
