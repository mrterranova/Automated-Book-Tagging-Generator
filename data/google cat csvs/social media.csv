Toward a Biocritical Sociology,['John William Neuhaus'],1996,['Philosophy'],"Works such as ""The Bell Curve"" imply that any biosocial approach to social science is necessarily Social Darwinist or reactionary. ""Toward a Biocritical Sociology"" suggests the opposite: a biosocial sociology stressing species commonalities opens a site for a distinctively critical social science discourse. Neuhaus shows the relevance of current research in ethology, sociobiology, and evolutionary ethics for the development of a critical biosocial sociology. In developing his own -biocritical- approach, Neuhaus argues that debates over social problems, as well as controversies surrounding the communitarian analyses of Robert Bellah, Amitai Etzioni and Alasdair MacIntyre, may be helpfully analyzed and conceptually unpacked by making use of a critical biosocial perspective.""",N/A,N/A,en
Justice and Egalitarian Relations,['Christian Schemmel'],2021,['Philosophy'],"This book delivers the first comprehensive development of a liberal conception of relational equality as a demand of social justice. Liberal egalitarian theories holding that justice requires a form of distributive equality in goods such as resources have been dominant for much of the last 50 years. Recently they have been subject to critique by relational egalitarians, who hold that the value of equality does not primarily require that people receive equal shares of some good, but that they relate as social equals, unencumbered by hierarchies of power and social status.",N/A,N/A,en
