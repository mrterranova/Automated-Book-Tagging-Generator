Multiagent Engineering,['Stefan Kirn'],2006-05-05,['Business & Economics'],"1 Multiagent Engineering: A New Software Construction Paradigm Multiagent systems have a long academic tradition. They have their roots in distributed problem solving in Artificial Intelligence (AI) from where they emerged in the mid-eighties as a distinctive discipline. Research in multiagent systems owes much to the work of Rosenschein on rationality and autonomy of intelligent agents, the European MAAMAW workshop series, and last but not least the famous readings of Bond & Gasser (1988) and Jacques Ferber ́s book on multiagent systems (1991). It gained further by a public discussion via the Distributed AI mailing list in summer 1991, when the pioneers of the field compared in much detail the concepts of distributed problem solvers to multiagent systems. Within only five years, a new exciting field of research had been established. Now, 15 years later, the field has matured to a degree that allows the - sults of academic research to be passed on to practical use and commercial exploitation. This potential coincides with a need for much larger flexib- ity of our IT infrastructure in light of its highly distributed character and extreme complexity, but also the global character of the business processes and the large number of business partners due to outsourcing and specia- zation. Many experts claim that multiagent systems are the right software technology for the needed IT infrastructure at the right time. The appeal has much to do with the broad perspectives of multiagent systems research.",N/A,N/A,en

Multi-platform Code Management,['Kevin Jameson'],1994,['Computers'],"For any programmer or team struggling with builds and maintenance, this book can save dozens of errors and hours of effort. It shows you how to structure a large project and keep your files and builds under control over many releases and platforms. The building blocks are simple: common-sense strategies, public-domain tools that you can obtain on a variety of systems, and special utilities developed by the author.On two diskettes provided with the book, Jameson offers a complete system for managing directories, makefile templates, and source code revisions. Both free software and tools developed by the author are included.The tools and ideas offered here are efficient enough to be used by one person working on a PC, but powerful enough to support entire teams of developers. They've been tested in practice on projects from 50 to 100,000 lines of code. And complete, documented source code is included, in case you need to modify or extend the tools.In short, this book is an inexpensive, ""one-stop-shopping"" solution for code management problems. It can help you improve your personal software development process and can make it very easy for you to reuse and update shared code files.Topics covered in this book include: Multi-platform directory structures for isolating and controlling platform dependent code.Automatic makefile generating tools to promote uniform, portable makefiles on your projects and to save you time.File sharing tools that make it easy to share the latest versions of files among multiple developers and software products, automatically. Since the sharing tools log all sharing operations, they can easily help you answer programming questions, such as, ""Where did this file come from, and which programs will be affected if I modify it?""RCSDO, a tool that performs version control operations on entire trees of files at a time. (RCS v5.5 is included, too.)The source code provided runs on at least these 15 platforms: AIX, Amiga, Apollo Domain, Dell PC Unix (SVR4), HP-UX, Irix4, Linux, MS-DOS (Borland), MS-DOS (Microsoft), OS/2, NetBSD, NeXT, Solaris 1 (SunOS 413), Solaris 2, and Ultrix. The RCS v5.5 software has been specially modified for DOS-Unix network use and is known to run on MS-DOS (Borland), MS-DOS (Microsoft), and Solaris 1.0 (SunOS 413). The diskettes also contain precompiled binaries for MSDOS.Here is a sample of the tools included on the diskettes: ""cmi"" copy a shared file from its public location to the directory where it can be used for builds""cmx"" copy a shared file from its source directory to a public location where other developers can get it""makenode"" make a directory structure to hold a product's source files in the form that the other tools can work with""newmakes"" generate makefiles throughout a product's directory structure""rcsdo"" do common activities on a group of RCS files in bulk""twalker"" generate a batch script that can traverse all files of a particular type in a directory tree",N/A,N/A,en

Contributions to Hardware and Software Reliability,"['P. K. Kapur', 'Santosh Kumar', 'R. B. Garg']",1999,['Computers'],"With better computing facilities now available, there is an ever-increasing need to ensure that elegant theoretical results on hardware reliability are computationally available. This book discusses those aspects which have relevance to computing systems and those where numerical computation was a problem. It is also well known that nearly 70% of the cost goes into software development and hence software reliability assumes special importance. The book not only gives an extensive review of the literature on software reliability but also provides direction in developing models which are flexible and can be used in a variety of testing environments. Besides, several alternative formulations of the release time problem are discussed along with variants such as allocation of testing effort resources to different modules of the software, or the testing effort control problem. Software reliability has now emerged as an independent discipline and requires a strong partnership between computer scientists, statisticians and operational researchers. This aspect is broadly highlighted in the book.",N/A,N/A,en

Testing Object-Oriented Software,"['David C. Kung', 'Chen-Ho Kung', 'Pei Hsia', 'Jerry Gao']",1998-11-10,['Computers'],"Object-oriented programming increases software reusability, extensibility, interoperability, and reliability. Software testing is necessary to realize these benefits. Software testing aims to uncover as many programming errors as possible at a minimum cost. A major challenge to the software engineering community remains how to reduce the cost and improve the quality of software testing. The requirements for testing object-oriented programs differ from those for testing conventional programs. Testing Object-Oriented Software illustrates these differences and discusses object-oriented software testing problems, focusing on the difficulties and challenges testers face. The book provides a general framework for class- and system-level testing and examines object-oriented design criteria and high testability metrics. It offers object-oriented testing techniques, ideas and methods for unit testing, and object-oriented program integration-testing strategy. Readers are shown how they can drastically reduce regression test costs, presented with steps for object-oriented testing, and introduced to object-oriented test tools and systems. In addition to software testing problems, the text covers various test methods developers can use during the design phase to generate programs with good testability. The book's intended audience includes object-oriented program testers, program developers, software project managers, and researchers working with object-oriented testing.",N/A,N/A,en

Laboratory Investigation of Geophysical Measurements in Clays,['Tommy Wai Kit Kam'],2020,['Civil engineering'],"Geophysical parameters such as the shear wave velocity, (shear wave velocity, primary wave velocity, and electrical resistivity) are often used in civil engineering practice to determining various soil properties. In this study, a series of laboratory controlled unconfined compression and consolidated undrained triaxial tests were performed on cohesive soils at California State University, Los Angeles from 2018 to 2020. Using reconstituted clay specimens mixed with either distilled water or a saline solution of 30g/L to mimic seawater conditions, triaxial tests were performed using the GeoComp-made Triaxial device according to ASTM D4767-11 and D2166-16 using special-made triaxial caps that can be used to either measure the electrical resistivity of the soil or the P-wave and S-wave velocities of the soil. The consolidated undrained triaxial testing consists of a saturation stage, consolidation stage, and shearing stage. The unconfined compression triaxial testing will use pre-consolidated clay specimens for testing. The results of this study will focus on results of the undrained shear strength of the soil and the geophysical measurements corresponding with each test. The study will also consider how the geophysical parameters are affected by the soil mineralogy, pore fluid, and stress history. The results of the study show that the electrical resistivity of the soil is affected by consolidation stress and the presence of bentonite. As the soil strength increases, the P-wave and S-wave velocities increases, but there is not much difference when comparing the results of the two types of pore fluids.",N/A,N/A,en

Hit Refresh is about individual change, the transformation happening inside Microsoft, and the arrival of the most exciting and disruptive wave of technology humankind has experienced - including artificial intelligence, mixed reality, and quantum computing. It examines how people, organisations, and societies can and must transform, how they must 'hit refresh' in their persistent quest for new energy, new ideas, and continued relevance and renewal. Yet at its core, it's about humans and how one of our essential qualities - empathy - will become ever more valuable in a world where technological advancement will alter the status quo as never before. In addition to his thoughts on these stunning scientific leaps, Satya Nadella discusses his fascinating childhood before immigrating to the U.S. and how he learned to lead along the way. He then shares his meditations as sitting CEO - one who is mostly unknown following the brainy Bill Gates and energetic Steve Ballmer. He explains how the company rediscovered its soul - transforming everything from its culture to its business partnerships to the fiercely competitive landscape of the industry itself. Nadella concludes by introducing an equation to restore digital trust, ethical design principles, and economic growth for everyone. 'Ideas excite me,' Nadella explains.
