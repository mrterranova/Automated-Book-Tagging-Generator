Räume,['Susanne Rau'],2013-04,['History'],"Auch Räume haben eine Geschichte oder umgekehrt: Geschichte findet immer auch in Räumen statt. Was aber sind Räume, und wie kann man sie historisch untersuchen bzw. in historische Analysen angemessen einbeziehen? Susanne Rau führt zunächst in verschiedene disziplinäre Zugänge zum Raum ein, von der Physik und der Geografie bis zur Philosophie. Anschließend erläutert sie, wie sich historische Raumanalysen methodisch-theoretisch konzipieren und praktisch durchführen lassen. Dazu stellt sie historische Beispiele vor allem aus den Bereichen Stadtgeschichte, Handelsgeschichte und Globalgeschichte vor. Erstmals liegt damit eine Einführung in die Theorie und Praxis der historischen Raumanalyse vor.",N/A,N/A

Flankenräume im mittelbyzantinischen Kirchenbau,['Lioba Theis'],2005,['Architecture'],"Spatbyzantinische Kirchenanlagen (seit dem 13. Jahrhundert) in den ehemaligen Kernbereichen von Byzanz, besonders in Konstantinopel, Griechenland, aber auch auf dem Balkan sind in der Regel vielteilig. Sie bestehen aus dem Kernbau von Bema, Naos und Narthex und werden haufig auf Nord- und Sudseite von Nebenraumen flankiert. Die vorliegende Untersuchung erbringt den Beweis, dass solche Anlagen schon in mittelbyzantinischer Zeit - sicher seit dem 10. Jahrhundert - in der Hauptstadt Konstantinopel entwickelt wurden und sich von dort in den byzantinischen Kernlanden, aber auch in allen von Byzanz beeinflussten Landern, z. B. in Russland, verbreitet haben. Form und Funktion dieser Raumteile im Verhaltnis zum Gesamtbau werden anhand des archaologischen Befundes der konstantinopolitanischen Beispiele exemplarisch untersucht.",N/A,N/A

Übersetzungsräume – Raumübersetzungen / Translation Spaces – Spaces in Translation,"['Jörg Wesche', 'Regina Toepfer', 'Peter Burschel']",2025-08-13,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"Der vorliegende Open Access-Band leuchtet den Zusammenhang von Übersetzung und Raum in spezifisch frühneuzeitlichen Untersuchungssettings exemplarisch aus. Dazu setzt er von zwei Seiten an: Erstens fragen Beiträge aus Germanistik, Judaistik, Latinistik und Romanistik sowie Kunst- und Philosophiegeschichte nach Übersetzungsräumen. Dadurch geraten jene kulturellen Transit- oder Kontaktzonen in den Blick, die durch Übersetzungs- und Mehrsprachigkeitsdynamiken geprägt sind. Zweitens fokussiert der Open Access-Band auf Raumübersetzungen. Hier stehen jene sprachlichen und kulturellen Übersetzungspraktiken im Mittelpunkt, die fremdkulturellen Begegnungen und Konfrontationssituationen erwachsen und sich in die kolonialen Diskurse der Frühen Neuzeit einschreiben. This open access volume illuminates the connection between translation and space in specifically Early Modern settings from two angles: Firstly the assembled contributions from the disciplines of German, Jewish studies, Latin and Romance as well as art, history and philosophy seek to identify translation spaces, those cultural transit or contact zones distinguished by high translation and multilingualism dynamics. Secondly, this volume draws attention to spatial translations. Here the focus is on linguistic and cultural translation practices that emerged from foreign-cultural encounters and confrontations and inscribed themselves in the colonial discourses of the Early Modern period.",N/A,N/A

Raumkonzepte,"['Ingrid Baumgärtner', 'Paul-Gerhard Klumbies', 'Franziska Sick', 'Mareike Kohls']",2009,['History'],"Concepts of space permeate not only scientific discourses and research initiatives but are a central element within the humanities as well. They determine the fundamental orientation of individual disciplines which study geographic, religious, territorial, literary, and social spaces. Such concepts are bound to specific socio-historical conditions and are, consequently, reflected in the production of various types of maps as well as in literary and biblical texts. By preserving and transforming knowledge, culturally generated spaces - from antiquity to modernity - have provided the point of departure for the establishment of various forms of social identity. The essays collected in this interdisciplinary study represent a range of approaches to research on space in a number of different academic disciplines. They consider the underlying concepts of space that inform each of the historical themes with which they are concerned in order to demonstrate how an awareness of taxonomies of spatial orientation provides the framework for new interpretations.

Translational Spaces,['Yifeng Sun'],2021,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"""This book explores the concept of space, or rather spaces, in relation to translation, to construct a conceptual framework for research to better understand and solve translation problems. A number of interrelated spatial perspectives on translation supported by empirical evidence are presented to help better understand the complexities between China and West in cultural exchanges and to offer a way of explaining what happens to translation and why it takes on a particular form. In the chequered history of Chinese-Western cultural exchange, effective communication has remained a great challenge exacerbated by the ultimate inescapability of linguistic and cultural incommensurability. It is therefore necessary to develop conceptual tools that can help shed light on the interactive association between performativity and space in translation. Despite the unfailing desire to connect with the world, transnational resistance is still underway in China. Further attempts are required to promote a convergence of Chinese and Western translation theories in general, and to confront problems arising from translation practice in particular. This work will be of interest to students and scholars in translation studies around the world, as well as those working in cultural studies and cross-cultural communication studies""--",N/A,N/A

Space to Reason,['Markus Knauff'],2013,['Philosophy'],"An argument against the role of visual imagination in reasoning that proposes a spatial theory of human thought, supported by empirical and computational evidence. Many scholars believe that visual mental imagery plays a key role in reasoning. In Space to Reason, Markus Knauff argues against this view, proposing that visual images are not relevant for reasoning and can even impede the process. He also argues against the claim that human thinking is solely based on abstract symbols and is completely embedded in language. Knauff proposes a third way to think about human reasoning that relies on supramodal spatial layout models, which are more abstract than pictorial images and more concrete than linguistic representations. He argues that these spatial layout models are at the heart of human thought, even thought about nonspatial relations in the world. For Knauff the visual images that we so often associate with reasoning are only in the foreground of conscious experience. Behind the images, the actual logical work is carried out by reasoning-specific operations on these spatial layout models. Knauff also offers a solution to the problem of indeterminacy in human reasoning, introducing the notion of a preferred layout model, which is one layout model among others that has the best chance of being mentally constructed and thus guides the further process of thought. Knauff's ""space to reason"" theory covers the functional, the algorithmic, and the implementational level of analysis and is corroborated by psychological experiments, functional brain imaging, and computational modeling.",N/A,N/A

Pilgrimage in the Hindu Tradition,['Knut A. Jacobsen'],2015-08-17,['Hindu pilgrims and pilgrimages'],"Salvific space is one of the central ideas in the Hindu traditions of pilgrimage, and concerns the ability of space, especially sites associated with bodies of water such as rivers and lakes, to grant salvific rewards. Focusing on religious, historical and sociological questions about the phenomenon, this book investigates the narratives, rituals, history and structures of salvific space, and looks at how it became a central feature of Hinduism. Arguing that salvific power of place became a major dimension of Hinduism through a development in several stages, the book analyses the historical process of how salvific space and pilgrimage in the Hindu tradition developed. It discusses how the traditions of salvific space exemplify the decentred polycentrism that defines Hinduism. The book uses original data from field research, as well as drawing on main textual sources such as Mahābhārata, the Purāṇas, the medieval digests on pilgrimage places (tīrthas), and a number of Sthalapurāṇas and Māhātmyas praising the salvific power of the place. By looking at some of the contradictions in and challenges to the tradition of Hindu salvific space in history and in contemporary India, the book is a useful study on Hinduism and South Asian Studies.",N/A,N/A

Ritual Journeys in South Asia,"['Jürgen Schaflechner', 'Christoph Bergmann']",2020,['Movement (Philosophy)'],"This book focuses on the ritualized forms of mobility that constitute phenomena of pilgrimage in South Asia and establishes a new analytical framework for the study of ritual journeys. The book advances the conceptual scope of 'classical' Pilgrimage Studies and provides empirical depth through individual case studies. A key concern is the strategies of ritualization through which actors create, assemble and (re-)articulate certain modes of displacement to differentiate themselves from everyday forms of locomotion. Ritual journeys are understood as being both productive of and produced by South Asia's socio-economically uneven, politically charged and culturally variegated landscapes. From various disciplinary angles, each chapter explores how spaces and movements in space are continually created, contested and transformed through ritual journeys. By focusing on this co-production of space and mobility, the book delivers a conceptually driven and empirically grounded engagement with the diverse and changing traditions of ritual journeying in South Asia. Interdisciplinary in its approach, the book is a must-have reference work for academics interested in South Asian Studies, Religious Studies, Anthropology and Human Geography with a focus on pilgrimage and the socio-spatial ideas and practices of ritualized movements in South Asia.",N/A,N/A

The View from Above,['Jeanne Haffner'],2013,['History'],"The role of aerial photography in the evolution of the concept of social space""and its impact on French urban planning in the mid-twentieth century. In mid-twentieth century France, the term ""social space"" ( l'espace social)--the idea that spatial form and social life are inextricably linked--emerged in a variety of social science disciplines. Taken up by the French New Left, it also came to inform the practice of urban planning. In The View from Above, Jeanne Haffner traces the evolution of the science of social space from the interwar period to the 1970s, illuminating in particular the role of aerial photography in this new way of conceptualizing socio-spatial relations. As early as the 1930s, the view from above served for Marcel Griaule and other anthropologists as a means of connecting the social and the spatial. Just a few decades later, the Marxist urban sociologist Henri Lefebvre called the perspective enabled by aerial photography--a technique closely associated with the French colonial state and military--""the space of state control."" Lefebvre and others nevertheless used the notion of social space to recast the problem of massive modernist housing projects (grands ensembles) to encompass the modern suburb (banlieue) itself--a critique that has contemporary resonance in light of the banlieue riots of 2005 and 2007. Haffner shows how such ""views"" permitted new ways of conceptualizing the old problem of housing to emerge. She also points to broader issues, including the influence of the colonies on the metropole, the application of sociological expertise to the study of the built environment, and the development of a spatially oriented critique of capitalism.",N/A,N/A

Led by the Nine Ruling Families, their leadership stands as a bulwark of stability against the Chaos of the Unknown Regions. But that stability has been eroded by a cunning foe that winnows away trust and loyalty in equal measure. Bonds of fidelity have given way to lines of division among the families.

Synthesizing educational theory, Marxist theory, and critical geography, the book articulates a revolutionary political pedagogy, one that emerges as a break from within—and against—critical pedagogy. Ford investigates the role of space in the context of emerging social movements and urban rebellions, with a focus on the Baltimore Rebellion of 2015, and shows how processes of learning, studying, and teaching can help us produce space differently, in a manner aligned with our needs and desires.",N/A,N/A

Spaces for Nostalgia,['Mario Panico'],2024-09-21,['Social Science'],"How is nostalgia expressed through space? Studies of nostalgia have long illustrated the emotional dynamics which condition our desire to go back to a time and a space that belong to the past. This book addresses this condition from an innovative perspective, by over-exposing the spatial dimension of nostalgia. Doing so unveils alternative and complementary ways of thinking through how this emotion is activated: in particular, how space – unlike time – can be recreated in the present, even in a different location, with the deliberate aim of consoling this bittersweet sensation. The volume defines this re-creation as a “space for nostalgia”. In this book, this concept is applied within the context of cultural heritage and difficult memories. As a further step, then, the volume questions the modalities through which nostalgia can interact with and permeate a space of memory, therefore influencing collective understandings and the emotional re-writings of our shared pasts. Through case studies relating to challenging nostalgias for troubled pasts in Western Europe, the book examines how the furnishing and use of space, the discourses that surround it, and the objects that become synecdoche of it provide a terrain where even unlikely or troubling forms of nostalgia can grow and blossom.",N/A,N/A

Meanings of an Urban Space,['Kimmo Katajala'],2016,['Espace'],"After wars, borders tend to shift. With changing borders, many towns have moved from one state to another. This may happen to one town several times during its history. These historical layers can still be seen in the urban space. Vyborg, a town in present-day Russia near the Finnish-Russian border, has just such a complex history. It has belonged to the Swedish realm, Russian Empire, Finland, the Soviet Union and now, again, to Russia. Traces of this multifaceted past are still visible in the town today. In this book, we study the processes that shaped the urban space of Vyborg and how its complex past and historical layers have been interpreted up until today.

Boundless Worlds,['Peter Wynn Kirby'],2009,['Science'],"Where lived experience of surroundings is shifting, visceral, and immersive, interpretation of social spaces tends to be static and remote. ""Space"" and ""place"" are also often analyzed without grappling much (if at all) with the social, political, and historical roots of spatial practice. This volume embarks upon the novel strategy of focusing on movement as a way of understanding social spaces, which offers a means to get beyond biases inherent in the social science of space. Ethnographic studies of social life in settings as varied as nomadic Mongolia and island Melanesia, as distinct as contemporary Tokyo and war-torn Palestine, challenge Western assumptions about the universality of ""space"" and allow concrete understanding of how life plays out over different socio-cultural topographies. In a world that is becoming increasingly ""bounded"" in many ways - despite enormous changes wrought by technological, ideological, and other social developments - Boundless Worlds urges a scholarly turn, away from the purely global, toward the human dimension of social lives lived in conditions of conflict, upheaval, remapping, and improvisation through movement.",N/A,N/A

"Leibniz on Time, Space, and Relativity","['Richard T. W. Arthur', 'Richard Arthur']",2021,['Philosophy'],"In this book, Arthur gives fresh interpretations of Gottfried Leibniz's theories of time, space, and the relativity of motion, based on a thorough examination of Leibniz's manuscripts as well as his published papers. These are analysed in historical context, but also with an eye to their contemporary relevance. Leibniz's views on relativity have been extremely influential, first on Mach, and then on Einstein, while his novel approach to geometry in his analysis situs inspired many later developments in geometry. Arthur expounds the latter in some detail, explaining its relationship to Leibniz's metaphysics of space and the grounding of motion, and defending Leibniz's views on the relativity of motion against charges of inconsistency. The brilliance of his work on time, though, has not been so well appreciated, and Arthur attempts to remedy this through a detailed discussion of Leibniz's relational theory of time, showing how it underpins his theory of possible worlds, his complex account of contingency, and his highly original treatment of the continuity of time, providing formal treatments in an appendix. In other appendices, Arthur provides translations of previously untranslated writings by Leibniz on analysis situs and on Copernicanism, as well as an essay on Leibniz's philosophy of relations. In his introductory chapter he explains how the framework for the book is provided by the interpretation of Leibniz's metaphysics he defended in his earlier Monads, Composition, and Force (OUP 2018, winner of the 2019 annual JHP Book Prize for best book in the history of philosophy published in 2018).",N/A,N/A

The Man who Walked in Color,['Georges Didi-Huberman'],2017,['Light in art'],"For Georges Didi-Huberman, artist James Turrell is an inventor of impossible spaces and unthinkable sites, of aporias, of fables. Creator of some of the most fascinating works of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, Turrell uses as his medium the most elemental material of sight and art: light. One crucial aspect of his work is the fabulation of place and vision with its foundation deep in history. Didi-Huberman takes the reader on a journey between the impossible limit of the horizon and the arrival into a site of reverie and light, from the story of Exodus to the Pala d'Oro of San Marco's Basilica in Venice, through art history and the origins of religious worship, finally plunging into Turrell's cadmium dust and light, into the Painted Desert of his installation Roden Crater. For the esteemed art historian, Turrell's artistic practice becomes the equivalent of walking along endless pathways in the desert, in ""minuscule cathedrals where man discovers himself walking in color.""",N/A,N/A

In addition to a comprehensive consideration of the role of atmospheres, the special significance of community in the context of these work spaces is examined in more detail. Two case studies in urban coworking spaces form the core of the investigation, following a qualitative research design oriented towards ethnography and a plurality of methods. In the context of the analysis, on the one hand, what constitutes coworking in everyday life and thus the new communality at work is considered: relevant practices and rituals, spatial arrangements and atmospheres are elaborated in their composition. On the other hand, coworkers, their spatial actions, and the attitudes associated with them come into closer focus: It is shown how users access coworking spaces as work and community spaces and what role atmospheres play. In addition, social entities are highlighted that are taken up by coworkers in relation to their coworking space and that help shape everyday coworking space life. Tensions that arise from the coexistence of community and service logic are also uncovered, and how they are dealt with is examined in more detail.",N/A,N/A

From Dar es Salaam to Bongoland,['Bernard Calas'],2010,['History'],"The name Dar es Salaam comes from the Arabic phrase meaning house of peace. A popular but erroneous translation is ëhaven of peaceí resulting from a mix-up of the Arabic words ""dar"" (house) and ""bandar"" (harbour). Named in 1867 by the Sultan of Zanzibar, The town has for a long time benefitted from a reputation of being a place of tranquility. The tropical drowsiness is a comfort To The socialist poverty and under-equipment that causes an unending anxiety to reign over the town. Today, For the Tanzanian, The town has become Bongoland, that is, a place where survival is a matter of cunning and intelligence (bongo means ëbrainí in Kiswahili). Far from being an anecdote, this slide into toponomy records the mutations that affect the links that Tanzanians maintain with their principal city And The manner in which it represents them. This book takes into account the changes by departing from the hypothesis that they reveal a process of territorialisation. What are the processesóenvisaged as spatial investmentsówhich, by producing exclusivity, demarcations and exclusions, fragment the urban space and its social fabric? Do the practices and discussions of the urban dwellers construct limited spaces, appropriated, identified and managed by communities (in other words, territories)? Dar es Salaam is often described as a diversified, relatively homogenous and integrating place. However, Is it not more appropriate to describe it as fragmented? as territorialisation can only occur through frequenting, management and localised investment, it is therefore through certain placesófirst shelter and residential area, then the school, daladala station, The fire hydrant And The quaysóthat the town is observed. This led to broach the question in the geographical sense of urban policy carried out since German colonisation to date. At the same time, The analysis of these developments allows for an evaluation of the role of the urban crisis And The responses it brings. In sum, The aim of this approach is to measure the impact of the uniqueness of the place on the current changes. On one hand, this is linked to its long-term insertion in the Swahili civilisation, and on the other, To its colonisation by Germany and later Britain and finally, To the singularity of the post-colonial path. This latter is marked by an alternation of Ujamaa with Structural Adjustment Plans applied since 1987. How does this remarkable political culture take part in the emerging city today?

Last War of the World-Island,['Alexander Dugin'],2015-05-26,['Political Science'],"Alexander Dugin traces the geopolitical development of Russia from its origins in Kievan Rus and the Russian Empire, through the peak of its global influence during the Soviet era, and finally to the current presidency of Vladimir Putin. Dugin sees Russia as the primary geopolitical pole of the land-based civilizations of the world, forever destined to be in conflict with the sea-based civilizations. At one time the pole of the seafaring civilizations was the British Empire; today it is represented by the United States and its NATO allies. Russia can only fulfill its geopolitical mission by remaining in opposition to the sea powers. Today, according to Dugin, this conflict is not only geopolitical in scope, but also ideological: Russia is the primary representative and defender of traditional values and idealism, whereas the West stands for the values of liberalism and the market-driven society. Whereas Russia began to lose sight of its mission during the 1990s and threatened to succumb to domination by the Western powers, Dugin believes that Putin has begun to correct its course and return Russia to her proper place. But the struggle is far from over: while progress has been made, Russia remains torn between its traditional nature and the temptations of globalism and Westernization, and its enemies undermine it at every turn. Dugin makes the case that it is only by remaining true to the Eurasian path that Russia can survive and flourish in any genuine sense - otherwise it will be reduced to a servile and secondary place in the world, and the forces of liberalism will dominate the world, unopposed. Alexander Dugin (b. 1962) is one of the best-known writers and political commentators in post-Soviet Russia, having been active in politics there since the 1980s. In addition to the many books he has authored on political, philosophical, and spiritual topics, he is the leader of the International Eurasia Movement, which he founded. For more than a decade, he has been an advisor to Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin on geopolitical matters, and was head of the Department of Sociology at Moscow State University.

It compares the specific features of their 'mental programmes' with that of their counterparts in other pre-modern societies. While analysing the importance of space in the medieval world view, the book discusses how medieval Indians comprehended their territories and the landscape as 'their own' vis-a-vis the 'alien' space; the development of territorial-cultural and territorial-political identities, and knowledge about other lands and peoples. In a discussion of medieval temporality, the book also studies the ways of perceiving and reckoning time, attitudes to the historical past and the manifold ways of recording it. A special chapter on 'Society' deals with socio-ethical values and behavioural stereotypes of major estate and caste groups like the feudal landlords, priests and officials, merchants and craftsmen, peasants and the lower castes in villages. The book also has a chapter on the medieval Indian perception of Man, his appearance and peculiarities as they pertained to the a≥ behaviour, social status, and the steady development of individuality. Medieval Indian Mindscapes will be of interest to medievalists as well as general readers, keen to know more about the dynamics of pre-modern history and culture.",N/A,N/A

Space,['Peter Merriman'],2022,['Science'],"Space is the first accessible text which provides a comprehensive examination of approaches that have crossed between such diverse fields as philosophy, physics, architecture, sociology, anthropology, and geography.

The book emphasises the multiple and partial construction of spaces through the embodied practices of diverse subjects, highlighting the contributions of feminists, queer theorists, anthropologists, sociologists and post-colonial scholars to academic debates. In contrast to contemporary studies which draw a clear line between scientific and particularly quantitative approaches to space and spatiality and more 'lived' human enactments and performances, this book highlights the continual influence of different mathematical and philosophical understandings of space and spatiality on everyday western spatial imaginations and registers in the twenty-first century.

Selected for one of the last space station missions of its kind before the program is dismantled, these astronauts and cosmonauts--from America, Russia, Italy, Britain, and Japan--have left their lives behind to travel at a speed of over seventeen thousand miles an hour as the earth reels below. We glimpse moments of their earthly lives through brief communications with family, their photos and talismans; we watch them whip up dehydrated meals, float in gravity-free sleep, and exercise in regimented routines to prevent atrophying muscles; we witness them form bonds that will stand between them and utter solitude. Most of all, we are with them as they behold and record their silent blue planet. Their experiences of sixteen sunrises and sunsets and the bright, blinking constellations of the galaxy are at once breathtakingly awesome and surprisingly intimate. Profound and contemplative, Orbital is a moving elegy to our environment and planet.",N/A,N/A

Between Urban Topographies and Political Spaces,"['Alexis Nuselovici', 'Fabio Vighi', 'Mauro Ponzi']",2014,['Literary Criticism'],"Between Urban Topographies and Political Spaces: Threshold Experiences uses the term ""threshold"" as a means to understand the relationship between Self and Other, as well as relationships between different cultures. The concept of ""threshold"" defines the relationship between inside and outside not in oppositional terms, but as complementaries. This book discusses the cultural and social ""border areas"" of modernity, which are to be understood not as ""zones"" in a territorial sense, but as ""spaces in between"" in which different languages and cultures operate. The essays in Between Urban Topographies and Political Spaces identify the dimension in urban topographies and political spaces where we are able to locate paradigmatic experiences of thresholds. Because these spaces are characterized by contradictions, conflicts, and aporias, we propose to rethink those hermeneutic categories that imply a sharp opposition between inside and outside. This means that the theoretical definition of threshold put forward in these essays--whether applied to history, philosophy, law, art, or cultural studies--embodies new juridical and political stances.se essays--whether applied to history, philosophy, law, art, or cultural studies--embodies new juridical and political stances.se essays--whether applied to history, philosophy, law, art, or cultural studies--embodies new juridical and political stances.se essays--whether applied to history, philosophy, law, art, or cultural studies--embodies new juridical and political stances.",N/A,N/A
Architecture as Experience,"['Dana Arnold', 'Andrew Ballantyne']",2004,['Architecture'],"""This book investigates the perception and appropriation of places across intervals of time and culture. The particular concern of the volume is to bring together fresh empirical research and animate it by contact with theoretical sophistication, without letting that overwhelm the material. The chapters establish the continuity of a particular physical object under discussion and show it in at least two different historical perspectives, in which recognizable features are shown in different lights. The results are often surprising, because we tend to have an idea of a historic place as having an enduring meaning, so it can be rewarding to learn about earlier constructions of meaning that involve the same building."" -- Publisher description.",N/A,N/A

Apollo to the Moon,['Teasel E.

Bold photographs, fascinating graphics, and engaging stories commemorate the 20th century's most important space endeavor: NASA's Apollo program to reach the moon. From the lunar rover and an emergency oxygen mask to space food and moon rocks, it's a carefully curated array of objects--complete with intriguing back stories and profiles of key participants. This book showcases the historic space exploration program that landed humans on the moon, advanced the world's capabilities for space travel, and revolutionized our sense of humanity's place in the universe. Each historic accomplishment is symbolized by a different object, from a Russian stamp honoring Yuri Gagarin and plastic astronaut action figures to the Apollo 11 command module, piloted by Michael Collins as Armstrong and Aldrin made the first moonwalk, together with the monumental art inspired by these moon missions. Throughout, Apollo to the Moon also tells the story of people who made the journey possible: the heroic astronauts as well as their supporters, including President John F.

Radical Space,"['Debra Benita Shaw', 'Maggie Humm']",2016,['Architecture'],"The spatial turn in the Humanities and Social Sciences has produced a considerable body of work which re-assesses space beyond the fixed Cartesian co-ordinates of Modernity and the nation state. In the process, space has been revealed as a productively contested concept with methodological implications across and between disciplines. The resulting understandings of space as fluid, changeable and responsive to the situation of bodies, both human and non-human has prepared the ground for radical concepts and uses of space with implications for how we conceive of contemporary lived reality. Rather than conceiving of bodies as constantly rendered docile within the spaces of the post-industrial nation state, Radical Space reveals how activists and artists have deployed these theoretical tools to examine and contest spatial practice.. Bringing together contributions from academics across the humanities and social sciences together with creative artists this dynamically multidisciplinary collection demonstrates this radicalization of space through explorations of environmental camps, new explorations of psychogeography, creative interventions in city space and mapping the extra-terrestrial onto the mundane spaces of everyday existence.",N/A,N/A

Space in Theory,['Russell West-Pavlov'],2009,['Literary Collections'],"Space in Theory: Kristeva, Foucault, Deleuze seeks to give a detailed but succinct overview of the role of spatial reflection in three of the most influential French critical thinkers of recent decades. It proposes a step-by-step analysis of the changing place of space in their theories, focussing on the common problematic all three critics address, but highlighting the significant differences between them. It aims to rectify an unaccountable absence of detailed analysis to the significance of space in their work up until now. Space in Theory argues that Kristeva, Foucault and Deleuze address the question: How are meaning and knowledge produced in contemporary society? What makes it possible to speak and think in ways we take for granted? The answer which all three thinkers provide is: space. This space takes various forms: psychic, subjective space in Kristeva, power-knowledge-space in Foucault, and the spaces of life as multiple flows of becoming in Deleuze. This book alternates between analyses of these thinkers' theoretical texts, and brief digressions into literary texts by Barrico, de Beauvoir, Beckett, Bodrozic or Bonnefoy, via Borges, Forster, Gide, Gilbert, Glissant, Hall, to Kafka, Ondaatje, Perec, Proust, Sartre, Warner and Woolf. These detours through literature aim to render more concrete and accessible the highly complex conceptulization of contemporary spatial theory. This volume is aimed at students, postgraduates and researchers interested in the areas of French poststructuralist theory, spatial reflection, or more generally contemporary cultural theory and cultural studies",N/A,N/A

Placing Disability,"['Susannah B. Mintz', 'Gregory Fraser']",2024-03-19,['Literary Criticism'],"Placing Disability presents an international collection of personal essays that address the experience of disability in particular geographical locations. Each chapter engages the question of what it means to be disabled in a specific place, exploring issues of movement, work and play, community and activism, artistic production, love and marriage, access and social services, family and friendship, memory and aging—all informed by the places that people inhabit. The book is organized in terms of topographies and vistas, rather than being bound by the map, to emphasize the defining, constitutive effects of place. The authors included in Placing Disability hail from different countries, neighborhoods, climates, and landscapes; from various backgrounds and professions; from a range of disciplinary perspectives and strategies. They are trained as academics, literary critics, poets, students, public speakers, memoirists, educators, philosophers, administrators, and activists. Their essays refine our understanding of the complex dynamic between self and circumstance as they survey the impact of geographical region on their life experiences. This book is intended to be useful in creative-writing workshops, Disability Studies seminars, and classes on environmental literature, and to appeal to general readers of memoir as well as to scholars of contemporary body theory or the Anthropocene.",N/A,N/A
Neuro-Futurism and Re-Imagining Leadership,['Kai Syng Tan'],2024-07-11,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"This book is a rip-roaring manifesto that re-claims ways to think about and do ‘leadership’. Colliding mobilities, neuro-queering, the arts and culture, critical leadership studies, social justice, creative pedagogy, futurity and Daoist cosmology for the first time, the book proposes ‘neuro-futurism’ as a beyond-colonial, heuristic change-making tool-kit for individuals and institutions. Celebrating the Dangerous, Demeaning and Dirty labour of Deviant/Defiant culture-workers often side-lined in (leadership) scholarship across 26 break-neck chapters and 39 images, this book challenges white-supremacist-cis-het-neuro-normative-capitalist-patriarchal forms of power and knowledge. Punchy, punching up and pulling no punches, it is a call to arms, feet, sole-soul, to co-create tables/houses/worlds that profit (neuro-)divergent people, planet, poetry and play.

Heterotopia and Globalisation in the Twenty-First Century,"['Simon Ferdinand', 'Irina Souch', 'Daan Wesselman']",2020,['Globalization'],"Can heterotopia help us make sense of globalisation? Against simplistic visions that the world is becoming one, Heterotopia and Globalisation in the Twenty-First Century shows how contemporary globalising processes are riven by heterotopian tension and complexities. A heterotopia, in Michel Foucault's initial formulations, describes the spatial articulation of a discursive order, manifesting its own distinct logics and categories in ways that refract or disturb prevailing paradigms. While in the twenty-first century the concept of globalisation is frequently seen as a tumultuous undifferentiation of cultures and spaces, this volume breaks new ground by interrogating how heterotopia and globalisation in fact intersect in the cultural present. Bringing together contributors from disciplines including Geography, Literary Studies, Architecture, Sociology, Film Studies, and Philosophy, this volume sets out a new typology for heterotopian spaces in the globalising present. Together, the chapters argue that digital technologies, climate change, migration, and other globalising phenomena are giving rise to a heterotopian multiplicity of discursive spaces, which overlap and clash with one another in contemporary culture. This volume will be of interest to scholars across disciplines who are engaged with questions of spatial difference, globalising processes, and the ways they are imagined and represented.",N/A,N/A

Framing Places,['Kim Dovey'],2007,['Architecture'],"Framing Places is an account of the nexus between place and power, investigating how the built forms of architecture and urban design act as mediators of social practices of power. Explored through a range of theories and case studies, this examination shows how lives are 'framed' within the clusters of rooms, buildings, streets and cities. These silent framings of everyday life also mediate practices of coercion, seduction and authorization as architects and urban designers engage with the articulation of dreams; imagining and constructing a 'better' future in someone's interest. This second edition has been thoroughly revised and updated to include a look at the recent Grollo Tower development in Melbourne and a critique on Euralille, a new quarter development in Northern France. The book draws from a broad range of methodology including: analysis of spatial structure discourse analysis phenomenology. These approaches are woven together through a series of narratives on specific cities - Berlin, Beijing and Bangkok - and global building types including the corporate tower, shopping mall, domestic house and enclave.",N/A,N/A

The book features historical interpretations on this topic, as well as context-specific and place-centric applications that will appeal to a wide range of scholars across disciplinary boundaries.

The book utilizes not only narratological frameworks but also concepts of space-focused humanity oriented social sciences, such as human geography, mobility studies, tourism studies, and qualitative/experience-based ethnography, in their post “narrative turn.” On this interface of narrative studies and spatial studies, this book pays concerted attention to the formation of affordances, or relations in which the human subject uses a space-time and things in it, in terms of passenger experience of the train carriage and its extension.
