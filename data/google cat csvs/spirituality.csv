My Big TOE Awakening Discovery Inner Workings,['Thomas Campbell'],2023-08-29,['Philosophy'],"Section 1 provides a biography of the author pertinent to the creation of this trilogy. This look at the author's unique experience sheds light upon the origins of this work. Section 2 logically justifies the basic conceptual building blocks needed to construct My Big TOE's foundation. It discusses the cultural beliefs that trap our thinking into a narrow and limited conceptualization of reality, defines the fundamentals of Big Pictureepistemology and ontology, and examines the inner-workings and practice of meditation. It defines and develops the two basic assumptions upon which this trilogy is based. From these two assumptions, time, space, consciousness, and the basic properties, purpose, and mechanics of our reality are logically inferred.Section 3 develops the interface and interaction between ""we the people""and our digital consciousness reality. It derives and explains the characteristics,origins, dynamics, and function of ego, love, free will, and our larger purpose. It develops the psi uncertainty principle as it explains and interrelates psi phenomena, free will, love, consciousness evolution, physics, reality, human purpose, digital computation, and entropy.Section 4 describes a model of consciousness that develops the results of Section 3 and supports the conclusions of Section 5. The origins and nature of digital consciousness are described along with how artificial intelligence (AI) leads to artificial consciousness, which leads to actual consciousness and to us. It derives our physical universe, our science, and our perception of a physical reality. The physical reality is directly derived from the nature of digital consciousness.Section 5 pulls together Sections 2, 3, and 4 into a model of reality that describes how an apparent nonphysical reality works, interacts, and interrelates with our experience of physical reality. Probable realities, predicting and modifying the future, teleportation, telepathy, multiple physical and nonphysical bodies, and the fractal nature of an evolving digital consciousness reality are explained and described in detail.Section 6 is the wrap-up that puts everything into a personal perspective. It points out My Big TOE's relationship with contemporary science and philosophy. It solidly integrates My Big TOE into traditional Western scientific and philosophical thought.",4.5,N/A,en

Catherine of Siena,['Thomas McDermott'],2008,['Religion'],"Although Catherine of Siena was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1970, relatively little attention has been given to her mystical thought, particularly in the English-speaking world.

Drawing on the Dialogue and also on Catherine¿s 381 letters and prayers, he explains clearly her principal teachings in relation to spiritual development, and identifies Catherine¿s possible sources as well as her areas of originality. By examining Catherine¿s life and mystical experiences, McDermott shows how she herself grew spiritually and how her growth corresponds to her later teaching on the ¿three stairs¿ on the ¿bridge of Christ crucified.¿ Finally, the author puts forward what he regards as the fundamental message of Catherine¿s life and teaching.

Flatland,['Edwin Abbott Abbott'],1991,['Computers'],"In 1884, Edwin Abbott Abbott wrote a mathematical adventure set in a two-dimensional plane world, populated by a hierarchical society of regular geometrical figures-who think and speak and have all too human emotions. Since then Flatland has fascinated generations of readers, becoming a perennial science-fiction favorite. By imagining the contact of beings from different dimensions, the author fully exploited the power of the analogy between the limitations of humans and those of his two-dimensional characters. A first-rate fictional guide to the concept of multiple dimensions of space, the book will also appeal to those who are interested in computer graphics. This field, which literally makes higher dimensions seeable, has aroused a new interest in visualization. We can now manipulate objects in four dimensions and observe their three-dimensional slices tumbling on the computer screen. But how do we interpret these images? In his introduction, Thomas Banchoff points out that there is no better way to begin exploring the problem of understanding higher-dimensional slicing phenomena than reading this classic novel of the Victorian era.",5,N/A,en

The Spiritual Origins of Eastern Europe and the Future Mysteries of the Holy Grail,['Sergei O. Prokofieff'],1993,['Religion'],"""And however paradoxical it may seem today, the 'Grail mood' is in the fullest sense to be found in Russia. And the future role that Russia will play in the sixth post-Atlantean epoch, a task of which I have so often had to speak, rests firmly upon this unconquerable 'Grail mood' in the Russian people."" --Rudolf Steiner (Nov. 3, 1918) Although Eastern Europe has been part of Christian humanity for more than a thousand years, its task and spiritual identity remain a mystery, the answer to which cannot be found unless we look behind outer historical events to the spiritual, meta-historical dimensions of history. This momentous work, breathtaking in its scope and detail, represents just such a penetrating, esoteric study of Eastern Europe in the light of Rudolf Steiner's spiritual research. Prokofieff shows how, from the earliest times, the future ""conscience of humanity"" flowed from hidden mystery centers in Hibernia to the eastern Slavic peoples. As a result, qualities of ""compassion, patience, and willingness for sacrifice"" developed in their souls, creating a truly Christian ""Grail mood."" Despite incalculable suffering--from the persecutions by the Mogul hordes of the thirteenth century to the Bolshevik experiment of the twentieth century--this quality has become an unconquerable force in the depths of their being. In illuminating the maya of outer history, Prokofieff reveals the forces that have been at work to hinder the progress and future intentions of humankind. Those adversarial forces have created a ""karma of materialism"" that the eastern Slavic peoples have taken upon themselves out of their exalted willingness for sacrifice. Will we be able to use the present opportunity granted by this sacrifice to fulfill the primary purposes of the present cultural epoch? Serious study of this book--intended for students of spiritual science--can lead to a profound awakening to the challenges that face humankind today.",N/A,N/A,en

The Alchemy of Happiness,['Abu Al-Ghazzali'],2021-10-12,[],"The Alchemy of Happiness is a work of Islamic philosophy by Persian theologian, philosopher, mystic, and moralist Al-Ghazzali. Written around AD 1105, this was one of many works by the great man to help Muslims clarify which aspects of contemporary philosophy contradicted the faith, and which supported it. In middle age, Al-Ghazzali was in the midst of a successful career as a well-known educator and guest at the court of a powerful vizier. Despite his accomplishments, he abandoned his lucrative posts in AD 1095 and disposed of his wealth, electing to live as an ascetic and mystic. He chose not to teach at state-sponsored schools anymore, opting for a life of seclusion and teaching at smaller, donation-supported schools. He was considered one of the renewers of Islam, who are said to appear at the start of each century to cleanse the faith and keep it pure. This belief was supported by Al-Ghazzali's writing. He wrote over seventy works during his lifetime, with another twenty attributed to him but unconfirmed. Near the beginning of the twelfth century, Al-Ghazzali wrote The Alchemy of Happiness. It is a shorter, Persian version of his previous work, The Revival of Religious Sciences, originally written in Arabic. It is one of his many works of Sufism, and is considered Al-Ghazzali's most important Persian writing. The first four chapters of this book are commentary on the famous traditional saying from Muhammad: ""He who knows himself knows God."" In the first chapter, Al-Ghazzali explains the knowledge of the self. Each of us has attributes of animals, devils, and angels, he writes, and it is up to us to determine which are which. Rather than indulging in earthly pleasures that come to us from our more brutish instincts, we should strive toward our angelic selves, and ""Contemplate the beauty of God."" The second chapter is concerned with the knowledge of God. Starting from the premise that man did not make himself, and that everything mortal man needs has been provided from ""the storehouse of creation,"" we begin to become aware of God's mercy and love. The events of a lifetime, even illness and suffering, are designed to lead individuals to God. In the next chapter, we learn about the world as it is. It is a place where we are put to prepare for our future journey-that is, to prepare for the afterlife. If we spend our time caring for our bodies and nourishing our souls through knowledge and love of God, we will be prepared for the next phase of our journeys to happiness. The final step in the alchemy is the knowledge of the next world. Each man possesses two souls: an animal and an angelic soul. The animal soul emits from the heart, and powers the organs and limbs of the body. When that heart ceases to beat, the animal soul dies. The angelic soul is not tied to the body, so when the animal soul dies, the angelic soul is freed. If that soul was tied to earthly pleasures like money and family, it will suffer from the loss of them. But if the soul had a lesser connection to the world and a stronger connection to God, then it will rejoice and be at peace. The remaining chapters of the book go into greater detail about religious life; exploring music, self-examination, and marriage as either aids or detractors to the work of the angelic soul. The primary thesis of The Alchemy of Happiness is that a life of self-discipline and devotion to God is fundamental to the joy of living. Al-Ghazzali's legacy was to bring Sufism, or Islamic mysticism, into the orthodoxy of Islam. He is considered by some to be the most important Muslim after the prophet Muhammad, and he was given the title ""The Proof of Islam"" during his life.",N/A,N/A,en
"Power of Raven, Wisdom of Serpent",['Noragh Jones'],1994,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","Through their oral culture, the communities of the highlands and islands handed down their traditions of life and spirituality from generation to generation. The womenfolk, in their many different roles, were the guardians of power and wisdom in 'seeing', healing, blessing and cursing. Noragh Jones describes the centuries-old rhythms of work, living and dying through the chants, rites and traditions kept by women. She concludes that the rifts and strains in modern society are not to be resolved by escaping to the fringes, but by our conscious efforts to recover the old and deep insights of these womenfolk in our own lives. Their qualities of hospitality and conviviality, together with their daily celebration of the ordinary, have much to teach us in our modern urban communities.",N/A,N/A,en

Human by Design,['Gregg Braden'],2017,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']","Human by Design invites you on a journey beyond Darwin's theory of evolution, beginning with the fact that we exist as we do, even more empowered, and more connected with ourselves and the world, than scientists have believed possible.* * *In one of the great ironies of the modern world, the science that was expected to solve life's mysteries has done just the opposite. New discoveries have led to more unanswered questions, created deeper mysteries, and brought us to the brink of forbidden territory when it comes to explaining our origin and existence. These discoveries reveal the following facts: - Fact 1. Our origin--Modern humans appeared suddenly on earth approximately 200,000 years ago, with the advanced brain, nervous system, and capabilities that set them apart from all other known forms of life already developed, rather than having developed slowly and gradually over a long periods of time.- Fact 2. Missing physical evidence--The relationships shown on the conventional tree of human evolution are speculative connections only. While they are believed to exist, a 150-year search has failed to produce the physical evidence that confirms the relationships shown on the evolutionary family tree.- Fact 3. New DNA evidence--The comparison of DNA between ancient Neanderthals, previously thought to be our ancestors, and early humans tells us that we did not descend from the Neanderthals.- Fact 4. A rare DNA fusion--Advanced genome analysis reveals that the DNA that sets us apart from other primates, including in our advanced brain and nervous system, is the result of an ancient and precise fusion of genes occurring in a way that suggests something beyond evolution made our humanness possible.- Fact 5. Our extraordinary abilities--We are born with the capacity to self-heal, to self-regulate longevity, to activate an enhanced immune response, and to experience deep intuition, sympathy, empathy, and, ultimately, compassion--and to do each of these on demand.In this book, New York Times best-selling author and 2017 Templeton Award nominee Gregg Braden crosses the traditional boundaries of science and spirituality to answer the timeless question at the core of our existence--Who are we?--and to reveal science-based techniques that awaken our uniquely human experiences of deep intuition, precognition, advanced states of self-healing, and much more! Beyond any reasonable doubt, Human by Design reveals that we're not what we've been told, and much more than we've ever imagined.",N/A,N/A,en

"Elijah, Prophet of Carmel",['Jane Ackerman'],2003,['Religion'],"Members of the three monotheistic faiths have always told stories of what the prophet Elijah has done and is still expected to do in sacred history. He is perhaps most appreciated by members of the Carmelite Order, known for its contemplative and pastoral orientation. Elijah is considered their legendary founder and traditional patron. Carmelites rank him as one of their greatest spiritual models. Their coat of arms displays his flaming sword, Mount Carmel, and Elijah's proclamation, ""With zeal I have been zealous for the Lord God of Hosts."" This book inquires into this deep appreciation. It examines the linkage between the Order and the prophet over time. More Information Beginning with the oldest knowledge we have about Elijah, coming from Scripture, Elijah Prophet of Carmel briefly sketches his role in the three faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It then turns to what the distant, but influential, Christian antecedents of the Carmelite Order, the desert hermits and the early Fathers, wrote about the zealous man of God. As the Carmelite Order was founded, achieved its corporate identity, and changed over time, so did its views of its legendary model. Interaction between storytelling about Elijah and Carmelites' understanding of themselves continues even to the present. As thoughts from the past about the prophet continue to influence them, both Teresian Carmelites and Carmelites of the Ancient Observance of our times are developing a brand-new tradition of him, the tradition of Elijah's double charism.",N/A,N/A,en

Waiting for God,['Simone Weil'],2021-05-17,[],"'You cannot get far in these essays without sensing yourself in the presence of a writer of immense intellectual power and fierce independence of mind.' - Janet Soskice, from the Introduction to the Routledge Classics edition Simone Weil (1909-1943) is one of the most brilliant and unorthodox religious and philosophical thinkers of the twentieth century. She was also a political activist who worked in the Renault car factory in France in the 1930s and fought briefly as an anarchist in the Spanish Civil War. Hailed by Albert Camus as ""the only great spirit of our times"", her work spans an astonishing variety of subjects, from ancient Greek philosophy and Christianity to oppression, political freedom and French national identity. Waiting for God is one of her most remarkable books, full of piercing spiritual and moral insight. The first part comprises letters she wrote in 1942 to Jean-Marie Perrin, a Dominican priest, and demonstrate the intense inner conflict Weil experienced as she wrestled with the demands of Christian belief and commitment. She then explores the ""just balance"" of the world, arguing that we should regard God as providing two forms of guidance: our ability as human beings to think for ourselves; and our need for both physical and emotional ""matter"". She also argues for the concept of a ""sacred longing""; that humanity's search for beauty, both in the world and within each other, is driven by our underlying desire for a tangible god. Eloquent and inspiring, Waiting for God asks profound questions about the nature of faith, doubt and morality that continue to resonate today.

Group Spirituality,['Roger Grainger'],2003,['Psychology'],"Group spirituality is an increasingly popular area of focus, and working in groups raises some very different and valuable consequences which wouldn't necessarily arise in a one-to-one encounter. In Group Spirituality, Roger Grainger, an author already established as an authority on Drama therapy, provides a functional guide to group spirituality and workshops. Derived from the authors' experiences of working with groups of people interested in exploring their own and other people's spirituality, Group Spirituality turns an abstract idea into a practical and recognizable experience. The nature of group work, the embodiment of ideas and feelings, and circumstances aiding personal encounter are discussed. Workshop examples aimed at establishing group identity and the introduction of the idea of the 'safe place' are explained. The symbolism of spiritual awareness is approached, and a firm distinction between spirituality and religion is made. Group Spirituality's approach to spirituality from a workshop focus, successfully attempts to embody spirituality and provide a framework for consciously examining and integrating spirituality within the rest of our life.",N/A,N/A,en

לקוטי תורה : אדם כי יקריב מכם,['Shneur Zalman (of Lyady)'],2004,['Religion'],"This discourse presents a modern-day perspective on the Biblical command to offer animal sacrifices. Rabbi Schneur Zalman teaches that each of us possesses certain character traits that can be seen as ""animalistic,"" or materialistic, in nature, which can lead a person toward material indulgence. Our mission, then, is to ""sacrifice"" and transform the animal within, through meditating upon the greatness of G-d. This ultimately alters the very composition of ones materialistic traits, so that they too may gain an appreciation of the spiritual, and develop a love for G-d. This volume, a member of the widely popular Chasidic Heritage Series, is complete with extensive notes, footnotes, and fluid English translation.",N/A,N/A,en
Falling Upward - a Companion Journal,['Richard Rohr'],2013,['Spiritual formation'],"Many, if not most, people and institutions remain in 'the first half of life' forever, preoccupied with establishing their identity, climbing, achieving, and performing. If you knew there was a further journey, wouldn't you choose to do the 'first half' quite differently? The further journey involves challenges, mistakes, loss of control, even 'necessary suffering', because that is how we grow. This message of falling down and in fact moving up is the most counter-intuitive message in most of the world religions, including and most especially Christianity. We grow spiritually much more by doing it wrong than by doing it right. The Companion Journal helps those who have (and those who have not) read Falling Upward to engage more deeply with the questions the book raises. Using a blend of quotes, questions for individual and group reflection, stories, and suggestions for spiritual practices, it provides a wise guide for deepening the spiritual journey - at any time of life.",N/A,N/A,en

Iyer reflects that this is perhaps the reason why many people--even those with no religious commitment--seem to be turning to yoga, or meditation, or tai chi. These aren't New Age fads so much as ways to rediscover the wisdom of an earlier age.""--Publisher's description.",N/A,N/A,en

From Science to God,['Peter Russell'],2004-12-22,['Philosophy'],"Peter Russell went from being a strict atheist and scientist to discovering a profound personal synthesis of the mystical and the scientific. That transition is the basis of this book. In From Science to God, he blends physics, psychology, and philosophy to reach a new worldview in which consciousness is a fundamental quality of creation. Russell shows how all the ingredients for this worldview are in place; it remains only to put the pieces together and explore the new picture of reality that emerges. Integrating a deep knowledge of science with his own experiences of meditation, Russell arrives at a universe similar to that described by many mystics -- one in which the inner and outer worlds no longer conflict. The bridge between them, he shows, is light, and this book invites readers to cross that bridge to find new meaning in God and a deeper significance in spiritual practice.",N/A,N/A,en
