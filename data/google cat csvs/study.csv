This book contains reports on the activities of these institutions during the 2010/2011 academic year, as well as the working papers developed by some of their most promising PhD students. The research presented in this book covers various aspects of Central European history in modern times, ranging from the 17th century to the present. (Series: Europa Orientalis - Vol. 12)",N/A,N/A,en

A Student's Guide to Intellectual Work,['Jean Guitton'],1964,['Education'],"""Rival auto manufacturers boast of the low fuel- consumption records racked up by their machines. In its aim, Jean Guitton's work corresponds to that of the auto manufacturers: he, too, is concerned with ""economy,"" but in his case it is that intellectual economy achievable through streamlined methods of thinking, reading, and writing. At one time or other, all people engaged in intellectual pursuits are confronted by the proper way to do a thing. Students especially, who have not yet learned their own capacities, are easily baffled and frustrated when a teacher asks them to re-do a paper, for example. ""How"" is the question. And even seasoned thinkers often discover that the process of working which they have evolved from trial and error does hot meet every new need. It is this gap in understanding how to think, how to study, how to write, etc., that the present work strives to fill. M. Guitton writes in a refreshing, informal style that cloaks (but does not hide) the insights with which a lifetime of teaching, acute powers of observation, and a profound sympathy for the problems of students have armed him.""--Back cover",N/A,N/A,en

"Recruiting, Advertising and Marketing Strategies in All-volunteer Force Nations","['Carol Stoker', 'Stephen Mehay']",2011,['Advertising'],"The recruiting environment in all-volunteer force (AVF) nations has changed dramatically in recent years. Low awareness of the Navy in each nation, combined with rapid changes in the media consumption habits of youth, present serious challenges to traditional military marketing approaches. The goal of this study is to provide a comparative analysis of marketing and advertising strategies that have been developed in four AVF nations in response to these challenges. The study focuses on the marketing strategies adopted by each nation's Navy for active duty enlisted recruits. The study is organized around four major areas. First, we assess social, demographic, and economic trends in each nation's external recruiting environment. Second, we discuss the structure of each nation's recruiting organization and its strategy development process. Third, we document various recruiting, marketing, and advertising initiatives in each nation. Finally, the study examines efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of specific marketing initiatives.",N/A,N/A,en

Study & Research Years 6-8,"['Imogene Forte', 'Marjorie Frank']",1999,['Information retrieval'],"This resource introduces middle years students to study and research. Each page invites the learner to try high interest, appealing exercises, which will help students with a new skill, reinforce an existing skill or assess a student's performance or understanding. This is no ordinary fill-in-the-blanks way to learn. These exercises are fun. Study and research is appropriately centred around a detective theme. Students will enjoy the activities and develop an understanding about research and how it works. The activities contained in Problem Solving are based on a sports theme in which students find solutions to unique dilemmas: which skier will win the most gold medals, how deep in debt a scuba diver gets buying new equipment and how many pizzas the cross-country team can eat after a race. Each page invites the learner to try high interest, appealing exercises that will help students with a new skill, reinforce an existing skill or assess a student's performance or understanding. This is no ordinary fill-in-the-blanks way to learn. These exercises are fun and surprising. Students will cultivate numerous skills including how to: identify and define a problem, eliminate excess information, create diagrams, charts or graphs, translate problems into equations, solve problems using statistical data, select appropriate operations for solving problems, choose and use formulas to solve problems, solve consumer problems involving interest and discounts, use logic to solve problems and check the accuracy of problem solutions.",N/A,N/A,en
