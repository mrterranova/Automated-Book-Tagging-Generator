The Last Oracle,['James Rollins'],2008-06-24,['Fiction'],"What if you could bioengineer the next great world prophet: scientifically produce the next Buddha, the next Muhammad, or the next Jesus? Would it mark the Second Coming or initiate a chain reaction with disastrous consequences? A master at combining historical and religious intrigue with edge-of-your-seat adventure, New York Times bestselling author James Rollins brings back SIGMA Force to battle a group of rogue scientists who've unleashed a bioengineering project that could bring about the extinction of humankind. In Washington, D.C., a homeless man dies in Commander Gray Pierce's arms, shot by an assassin's bullet. But the death leaves behind a greater mystery: a bloody coin found clutched in the dead man's hand, an ancient relic that can be traced back to the Greek Oracle of Delphi. As ruthless hunters search for the stolen artifact, Gray Pierce discovers that the coin is the key to unlocking a plot that dates back to the Cold War and threatens the very foundation of humanity. An international think tank of scientists known as the Jasons has discovered a way to bioengineer autistic children who show savant talents—mathematical geniuses, statistical masterminds, brilliant conceptual artists—into something far greater and far more frightening, in hopes of creating a world prophet for the new millennium, one to be manipulated to create a new era of global peace . . . a peace on their own terms. Halfway around the world, a man wakes up in a hospital bed with no memory of who he is, knowing only that he's a prisoner in a subterranean research facility. With the help of three unusual children, he makes his escape across a mountainous and radioactive countryside, pursued by savage hunters bred in the same laboratory. But his goal is not escape, nor even survival. In order to thwart a plot to wipe out a quarter of the world's population, he must sacrifice all, even the children who rescued him. From ancient Greek temples to glittering mausoleums, from the slums of India to the toxic ruins of Russia, two men must race against time to solve a mystery that dates back to the first famous oracle of history—the Greek Oracle of Delphi. But one question remains: Will the past be enough to save the future?",N/A,N/A

Two years after the events of You Will Never Find Me (Europa, 2015), Boxer is contemplating retirement. He has found a measure of contentment even as a mystery from his own past gnaws at his sense of justice. Mercy balances a complicated personal life with an even more precarious professional one in the woefully under-resourced metropolitan police department. Both are suddenly pulled back into service when six children of wealthy families vanish, taken by a ruthlessly efficient organization with a single astonishing demand. Investigators stymied and time expiring, they seem set on a calamitous course. Trapped, off-balance, and with little left to lose they plunge into a cauldron of warring intelligence agencies, morally destitute billionaires, and human traffickers, coming finally to a fateful Moroccan reckoning that will forever change them. The latest entry in Robert Wilson's acclaimed Charlie Boxer series, Stealing People is both topical and thrilling. Wilson unravels a convincing web of international intrigue in a world where heroism may breed vice and virtue is an accidental byproduct of crime.",N/A,N/A

The contributors examine such topics as the attractions of open space and rural gentrification in shaping urban development; the role of tourism in developing national parks, historical sites, and California's Napa Valley; and the roles of public art, gender, and ethnicity in shaping urban centers.

Every Step You Take,['Judith Kelman'],2004-06,['Fiction'],"John Adams and Benjamin Rush were two remarkably different men who shared a devotion to liberty. Their dialogues on the implications of fame for their generation prove remarkably timely—even for the twenty-first century. Adams and Rush championed very different views on the nature of the American Revolution and of the republic established with the United States Constitution; yet they shared one of the most important correspondences of their time. John Adams and Benjamin Rush met in 1774 as members of the Continental Congress—Adams from Massachusetts, Rush from Pennsylvania. In 1805, after Adams was defeated in his quest of a second term as the new republic's second President, the two men self-consciously commenced an exchange of letters. Their recurring subject was fame. This emphasis on fame was crucial, Adams and Rush believed, because on the fame attached to individual leaders of the Revolutionary generation would depend the view of the Revolution and of the Constitution and republican government that would be embraced by generations to come, including our own. The new Liberty Fund edition of The Spur of Fame reproduces a text originally published by the Huntington Library. Douglass Adair (1912–1968) edited the William and Mary Quarterly from 1947 to 1955, and was a greatly influential professor and writer.
