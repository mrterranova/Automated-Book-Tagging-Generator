San Petersburgo, 11 de diciembre de 17** Te alegrará saber que no ha ocurrido ningún percance al principio de una aventura que siempre consideraste cargada de malos presagios. Llegué aquí ayer, y mi primera tarea es asegurarle a mi querida hermana que me hallo perfectamente y que tengo una gran confianza en el éxito de mi empresa. Me encuentro ya muy al norte de Londres y, mientras camino por las calles de Petersburgo, siento la brisa helada norteña que fortalece mi espíritu y me llena de gozo. ¿Comprendes este sentimiento? Esta brisa, que llega desde las regiones hacia las que me dirijo, me trae un presagio de aquellos territorios helados. Animadas por ese viento cargado de promesas, mis ensoñaciones se tornan más apasionadas y vividas. En vano intento convencerme de que el Polo es el reino del hielo y la desolación: siempre se presenta a mi imaginación como la región de la belleza y del placer. Allí, Margaret, el sol siempre permanece visible, con su enorme disco bordeando el horizonte y esparciendo un eterno resplandor. Allí —porque, con tu permiso, hermana mía, debo depositar alguna confianza en los navegantes que me precedieron—, allí la nieve y el hielo se desvanecen y, navegando sobre un mar en calma, el navío se puede deslizar suavemente hasta una tierra que supera en maravillas y belleza a todas las regiones descubiertas hasta hoy en el mundo habitado.",N/A,N/A,es

The Sea-craft of Prehistory,['Paul Johnstone'],1988,['Social Science'],"A detailed account of man's use of inland and ocean-going craft from the earliest times until the dawn of history, using new archaeological research. All forms of evidence are assessed, from the vessels of ancient Egypt to the Chinese junk.The nautical dimension of prehistory has not so far received the attention it deserves. It is also too often assumed that early man was land bound, yet this is demonstrably not the case. Recent research has shown that man travelled and tracked over greater distances and at a much earlier date than has previously been thought possible. Some of these facts can be explained only by man's mastery of water transport from earliest times. This book, by an acknowledged expert on prehistoric sea-craft, examines these problems looking at the new archaeological information in the light of the author's nautical knowledge. The result is a detailed account of man's use of inland and ocean-going craft from earliest times until the dawn of recorded history. All forms of evidence are critically assessed, from the vessels of Ancient Egypt to the Chinese junk, to present of comprehensive picture of the vessels men have built through the ages, and of the variety of ways in which they have been used.",N/A,N/A,en
King Solomon’s Mines,['H. Rider Haggard'],2023-07-09,['Fiction'],"King Solomon’s Mines was published in September 1885, becoming an immediate best seller by tapping into people’s excitement for the unknown: in this case, the unexplored regions of Africa. Haggard wrote the novel in a very short period, between six and sixteen months, on a bet with his brother to try to match Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island. In the process he created a new literary genre known as the “Lost World” genre, which would later influence other writers like Arthur Conan Doyle and H. P. Lovecraft. The book tells the tale of Allan Quatermain, an adventurer and hunter, who is approached by Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good to help them find Curtis’ lost brother, who went missing while trying to find the fabled King Solomon’s Mines.

"The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia",['Samuel Johnson'],2023-04-05,['Fiction'],"Rasselas is a fable-like story, more apologue than novel, written by Johnson in 1759 to help pay for the costs of his recently-deceased mother’s funeral. While the plot is basic and the characters are thin, the work is an important philosophical piece exploring whether or not humanity can attain happiness. Rasselas, an Abyssinian prince, travels with his sister Nekayah, her handmaiden Pekuah, and the wise poet Imlac—a proxy for Johnson himself. Their exploration of happiness and the meaning of leading a happy life is a complex and subtle one, though the work ends with “nothing concluded.” Johnson leaves the reader to ponder: Can an individual ever attain happiness in any meaningful sense?",N/A,N/A,en

After being convicted of treason, Blood and some of the rebels are sentenced to slavery in the Caribbean. The year is 1688. During the course of Blood’s servitude, he works on the sugar plantation of Colonel Bishop and becomes infatuated with the colonel’s niece, Arabella.

Several of the other escapees turn out to be experienced seaman, including as officers in the British navy. This group turns the Spanish ship into a very successful pirate ship, specializing in raiding Spanish shipping. This begins Captain Blood’s journey toward redemption and his “courtship” of Arabella. Sabatini based Blood’s character on several historical figures, including a doctor who was sentenced to slavery (but did not become a pirate), as well as Henry Morgan (who was a pirate).

Man and Superman,['George Bernard Shaw'],2023-06-03,['Fiction'],"Following the death of her father, Ann Whitefield becomes the ward of Jack Tanner and Roebuck Ramsden; Jack is a childhood friend, author of The Revolutionist’s Handbook, and descendant of Don Juan, while Roebuck Ramsden is a respectable friend of her father’s entirely opposed to Jack’s philosophy. Also in mourning are Octavius Robinson, who is openly in love with Ann, and his sister Violet, who is secretly pregnant. So begins a journey that will take them across London, Europe, and to Hell. George Bernard Shaw wrote Man and Superman between 1901 and 1903. It was first performed in 1905 with the third act excised; a part of that third act, Don Juan in Hell, was performed in 1907. The full play was not performed in its entirety until 1915. Shaw explains that he wrote Man and Superman after being challenged to write on the theme of Don Juan. Once described as Shaw’s most allusive play, Man and Superman refers to Nietzsche’s concept of the Übermensch. It combines Nietzsche’s argument that humanity is evolving towards a “superman” with the philosophy of Don Juan as a way to present his conception of society: namely, that it is women who are the driving force behind natural selection and the propagation of the species. To this end, Shaw includes as an appendix The Revolutionist’s Handbook and Pocket Companion as written by the character Jack Tanner.",N/A,N/A,en

Don't Shoot the Albatross!,['Jonathan Eyers'],2012-12-19,['Sports & Recreation'],"Sailors are a notoriously superstitious lot - even if some won't admit it. Years of taking to the water, at the mercy of uncontrollable (and sometimes deadly) forces, have led even the wisest to seek ways of influencing the gods or fate. From bad omens and odd rituals to lucky tokens and forbidden words, the superstitions of the sea are legion. Many of these superstitions have refused to go away and quite a few have entered the general public consciousness. Some are amusing in their own right, others have fascinating origins, whilst for many there are bizarre anecdotal incidents which would appear to lend credence to these arcane beliefs.

An Introduction to Turbulent Flow,"['Jean Mathieu', 'Julian Scott']",2000-06-26,['Science'],"Most natural and industrial flows are turbulent. The atmosphere and oceans, automobile and aircraft engines, all provide examples of this ubiquitous phenomenon. In recent years, turbulence has become a very lively area of scientific research and application, attracting many newcomers who need a basic introduction to the subject. An Introduction to Turbulent Flow, first published in 2000, offers a solid grounding in the subject of turbulence, developing both physical insight and the mathematical framework needed to express the theory. It begins with a review of the physical nature of turbulence, statistical tools, and space and time scales of turbulence. Basic theory is presented next, illustrated by examples of simple turbulent flows and developed through classical models of jets, wakes, and boundary layers. A deeper understanding of turbulence dynamics is provided by spectral analysis and its applications. The final chapter introduces the numerical simulation of turbulent flows.

The Conquest of Bread,['Peter Kropotkin'],2023-06-23,['Fiction'],"The Conquest of Bread is a political treatise written by the anarcho-communist philosopher Peter Kropotkin. Written after a split between anarchists and Marxists at the First International (a 19th-century association of left-wing radicals), The Conquest of Bread advocates a path to a communist society distinct from Marx and Engels’s Communist Manifesto, rooted in the principles of mutual aid and voluntary cooperation. Since its original publication in 1892, The Conquest of Bread has immensely influenced both anarchist theory and anarchist praxis. As one of the first comprehensive works of anarcho-communist theory published for wide distribution, it both popularized anarchism in general and encouraged a shift in anarchist thought from individualist anarchism to social anarchism. It was also an influential text among the Spanish anarchists in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, and the late anarchist theorist and anthropologist David Graeber cited the book as an inspiration for the Occupy movement of the early 2010s in his 2011 book Debt: The First 5,000 Years.",N/A,N/A,en

Titanic or Olympic: Which Ship Sank?,"['Steve Hall', 'Bruce Beveridge', 'Art Braunschweiger']",2012-02-28,['Transportation'],"The Titanic is one of the most famous maritime disasters of all time, but did the Titanic really sink on the morning of 15 April 1912? Titanic's older sister, the nearly identical Olympic, was involved in a serious accident in September 1911 – an accident that may have made her a liability to her owners the White Star Line. Since 1912 rumours of a conspiracy to switch the two sisters in an elaborate insurance scam has always loomed behind the tragic story of the Titanic. Could the White Star Line have really switched the Olympic with her near identical sister in a ruse to intentionally sink their mortally damaged flagship in April 1912, in order to cash in on the insurance policy? Laying bare the famous conspiracy theory, world-respected Titanic researchers investigate claims that the sister ships were switched in an insurance scam and provide definitive proof for whether it could - or could not - have happened.",5,N/A,en

Queen Victoria,['Lytton Strachey'],2023-03-26,['Fiction'],"The publication of Lytton Strachey’s Eminent Victorians in 1918 was a tremendous success. In it, Strachey looked at four iconic figures of the Victorian Age and punctured the hagiographical illusions surrounding them. It seems only fitting that he should follow up in 1921 with a similarly unsentimental but fair biography of the person at the pinnacle of that era, Queen Victoria herself. Thoroughly researched, with his references documented in hundreds of footnotes, Strachey looks at the life of the young woman who, when she was born, was by no means certain to become the British monarch. He also spends considerable time on her consort, Prince Albert, who, in Strachey’s telling, develops from a careless youth to becoming a truly remarkable and effective figure in British society, while continuing to be generally perceived as an outsider. Strachey’s sardonic and witty style makes this account of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert an entertaining and very informative read.",N/A,N/A,en

Henry VIII,['William Shakespeare'],2023-07-02,['Fiction'],"Henry VIII is one of the few of Shakespeare’s plays thought to have been written with a collaborator. It was initially published in the First Folio under Shakespeare’s name only, but in 1850 James Spedding, an English author and expert on the works of Francis Bacon, suggested that the play was a collaboration with John Fletcher, a playwright who later replaced Shakespeare in the King’s Men acting company. Modern scholars mostly tend to agree, though the theory is still controversial as it’s based on textual analysis and not any historical mention of a collaboration. The play is also famous for having burned down the Globe Theatre in 1613 during one of its early performances, when a cannon shot special effect lit the theater’s thatched roof on fire. In the play, King Henry’s closest advisor, Cardinal Wolsey, is hated by the citizens of England. Wolsey has imposed unfair taxes and unpopularly executed the Duke of Buckingham for treason. While at a party, the King falls madly in love with Anne Bullen and plans to divorce his current wife, Katherine of Aragon. Wolsey is asked to help his King in this endeavor, all the while becoming even more hated by the English and their Queen.

Emma,['Jane Austen'],2023-07-04,['Fiction'],"""Emma,"" a cherished novel written by acclaimed author Jane Austen, is a hallmark of English literature classics. Known for her insightful depictions of human nature and society, Austen shines in this narrative, making it an essential read for those seeking Jane Austen novels. The story centers on the young, wealthy, and clever Emma Woodhouse, a compelling representation of strong female protagonists. Living with her hypochondriac father in the fictional village of Highbury, Emma embodies both charm and naivety. Despite her numerous admirable qualities, she often misjudges others, particularly when it comes to affairs of the heart. This flaw of Emma’s sets the stage for one of the most engrossing Victorian matchmaking stories. Emma, uninterested in seeking a husband for herself, chooses instead to play matchmaker for her friend Harriet Smith, an unsophisticated orphan. Her misplaced certainty in her matchmaking skills and her dismissal of Harriet's own feelings create a web of miscommunication and unintended consequences, typical in Regency-era social comedies. As the narrative unfolds, we see the outcomes of Emma's ill-guided attempts at matchmaking - misunderstandings, romantic blunders, and heartache. Yet, amid these trials, Emma embarks on a journey of self-discovery and growth. She moves from a well-meaning but naive matchmaker to a mature woman who recognizes her own heart's longing and her errors in judgement, marking a compelling coming of age narrative. Austen's intricate storytelling, combined with her sharp social commentary, imbues ""Emma"" with a timeless quality. The novel presents a journey of personal growth, a witty critique of societal norms, and a delightful romantic comedy, appealing to a wide range of readers.

F.,” suggest that Journal is based on accounts of Defoe’s uncle, Henry Foe. This highly readable short novel is fascinating not just as a historical account, but in its description of how people reacted to a deadly disease that they understood to be contagious, but yet had no cure for. Defoe derides quack doctors who killed more than they saved, and then themselves succumbed to plague. He tells of people turning to religion; of people driven mad by the death around them and raving in the streets; of people fleeing to the country, and of others barricading themselves in their homes. The ways people reacted in 1665 could be the very same ways people might have reacted today to a mysterious, deadly, and highly contagious outbreak.",N/A,N/A,fr

The Tempest,['William Shakespeare'],2023-05-05,['Fiction'],"The Tempest, thought to be one of the last plays that Shakespeare wrote alone, begins with a storm which shipwrecks the king of Naples and his crew. We quickly learn that the tempest was not a natural occurence; it was created by Prospero, the usurped duke of Milan who is stranded on a nearby island, with the help of Ariel, a spirit in his service. The rest of the play explores the relationships between the shipwrecked crew, Prospero, his daughter Miranda, and a native of the island: a half human, half monster called Caliban. Though this play is traditionally classified as a comedy, more modern scholarship, out of a desire to highlight the dramatic elements of some of Shakespeare’s comedies, created a genre subgroup called the “late romances.” The Tempest is included in that subgroup. This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.",N/A,N/A,en

Weld Like a Pro,['Jerry Uttrachi'],2015-06-15,['Transportation'],"Welding is an art and skill that's essential for automotive fabrication, repair, and vehicle upgrades, but it is also an important skill for countless household projects and industries. Some books show merely basic welding techniques with steel and cast iron. But this isn't your run-of-the-mill introductory welding book. In this revised edition of the previous title, Advanced Automotive Welding, Jerry Uttrachi, past president of the American Welding Society, does show you how to perform basic welding procedures with steel and cast iron. But he also reveals advanced welding techniques and the use of aluminum, titanium, magnesium, stainless steel, and other specialty materials. Projects and techniques in this book focus on automotive applications but can also be used for welding a bicycle frame, welding a steel grill, or repairing the frame for a garden bench. TIG, oxyacetylene, arc, and wire-feed welding processes are covered, but special coverage is provided for stick and MIG. Welding butt and V-joints is explained plus welding more complex joints, including J- and U-joints, is also shown. Step-by-step instruction and exceptional detail give you the necessary information to tackle and complete complex welding jobs. Popular automotive projects, such as welding an electric fuel pump into an aluminum tank, repairing chromemoly suspension arms, and welding in floorpans, are thoroughly covered. And when it comes to repairing household items, specific projects such as repairing and modifying the steel tubing on an exercise machine, repairing a decorative bench, and more are covered. Rather than take a project to a shop, you can now do the job at home. Whether you're new to welding or a veteran welder looking to work with special materials or involved in a special project, you will find indispensible information within the pages of this book. Now you can confidently weld with steel, cast iron, aluminum, anodized steel, titanium, magnesium, and other specialty metals.",N/A,N/A,en
Archaeological Oceanography,['Robert D. Ballard'],2008-07-21,['Science'],"Archaeological Oceanography is the definitive book on the newly emerging field of deep-sea archaeology. Marine archaeologists have been finding and excavating underwater shipwrecks since at least the early 1950s, but until recently their explorations have been restricted to depths considered shallow by oceanographic standards. This book describes the latest advances that enable researchers to probe the secrets of the deep ocean, and the vital contributions these advances offer to archaeology and fields like maritime history and anthropology. Renowned oceanographer Robert Ballard--who stunned the world with his discovery of the Titanic deep in the North Atlantic--has gathered together the pioneers of archaeological oceanography, a cross-disciplinary group of archaeologists, oceanographers, ocean engineers, and anthropologists who have undertaken ambitious expeditions into the deep sea. In this book, they discuss the history of archaeological oceanography and the evolution and use of advanced deep-submergence technology to locate and excavate ancient and modern shipwrecks and cultural and other sites deep under water. They offer examples from their own expeditions and explain the challenges future programs face in obtaining access to the resources needed to carry out this important and exciting research. The contributors are Robert D. Ballard, Ali Can, Dwight F. Coleman, Mike J. Durbin, Ryan Eustace, Brendan Foley, Cathy Giangrande, Todd S. Gregory, Rachel L.

Flagships of imperialism,['Freda Harcourt'],2013-07-19,['History'],"Flagships of Imperialism is the first scholarly monograph on the history of the P&O shipping company, and the first history of P&O to pay due attention to the context of nineteenth century imperial politics which so significantly shaped the company’s development. Based chiefly on unpublished material from the P&O archives and the National Archives, and on contemporary official publications, the book covers the crucial period from the company’s origins to 1867. After presenting new findings about the company’s origins in the Irish transport industry, the book charts the extension of the founders’ interests from the Iberian peninsula to the Mediterranean, India, China and Australia. In so doing it deals with the development of the necessary financial infrastructure for P&O’s operations; the founders’ attitudes to technical advances; the shareholding base; the company’s involvement in the opium trade, and with its acquisition of mail, Admiralty and other government contracts. It was the P&O’s status as a government contractor which, above all else, implicated its fortunes in the wider politics of empire, as illustrated by the book's concluding account of the company’s rescue from the edge of a financial precipice by the award of a new government mail contract prompted, among other things, by the Abyssinian expedition of 1867. Flagships of Imperialism will be of interest to transport and company historians and to historians of the British empire alike, as well as to anyone interested in the history of British ships and shipping in the nineteenth century.",N/A,N/A,en

Erewhon,['Samuel Butler'],2023-05-17,['Fiction'],"In a desire for better sheep-farming land on an unnamed British colony, Higgs decides to traverse the distant mountain range. On the other side he discovers not the empty rolling plains of his imagination but an entirely new civilization: the land of Erewhon. Inducted into the ways of their culture, he attempts to transcribe as best he can their thoughts on birth, death, machines, the production of food, their financial system, and many more subjects that on first glance seem absurd to the narrator but often end up revealing absurdity in his own thinking. Erewhon was extremely well received on its initial (and anonymous) publication, with its satirical commentary on contemporary Victorian attitudes ensuring its commercial success. Samuel Butler incorporated into the novel his philosophical ideas, including chapters founded on his interest in Darwinian evolution theory, and on the potential rise in artificial consciousness. George Orwell held the novel in high regard, and the Erewhonian philosophy on the danger of machines even made its way into Frank Herbert’s Dune series as the “Butlerian jihad.”",N/A,N/A,en
Lighthouses of Europe,['Thomas Ebelt'],2018-11-15,['Travel'],"Europe has over 40,000 miles of coastline, stretching from the icy black waters of the Baltic to the deceptively serene Mediterranean. With many of Europe's countries bordering a sea, the need for lighthouses has spanned much of the continent for centuries. Lighthouses hold a perennial fascination for many of us - an indicator of danger, a beacon of the sea, laced with history and romance and a magnet for coastal walkers and visitors. Photographer Thomas Ebelt was charged with capturing beautiful imagery of the most stunning lighthouses for a lavish calendar, but on his journeys along Europe's coasts he found enough outstanding structures and dramatic landscapes to fill a calendar every year for a decade or more. This book is a collection of his finest photographs, from Poland and Estonia, via Iceland, around Scotland and England, and towards Malta and Sicily.

The Influence of Air Power Upon History,['Walter J. Boyne'],2003-05-31,['History'],"“A comprehensive, balanced overview of war in the air” from a world-renowned authority on aviation history and New York Times–bestselling author (Booklist). The Influence of Air Power Upon History makes a startlingly new analysis of the far-reaching implications flight has had on warfare, politics, diplomacy, technology, and mass culture. Author Walter Boyne examines the application of air power from the very earliest days of the balloon down to the current era of space warfare and postulates some new and controversial theories that are certain to arouse comment. Where Alfred Thayer Mahan’s classic work, The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, catalogues the elements that made naval prowess a determinant of a nation’s strength, The Influence of Air Power Upon History traces the development of air-power philosophy by examining the theory and practice of air power as it is exercised in both war and peace. The author unerringly depicts the contributions made by the people and planes of each era, some of them famous, some virtually unknown, but all vitally important. He highlights the critical competence of individuals at every step of the way, comparing the works of Guilio Douhet, William Mitchell, John Warden, and others philosophically, even as he compares the combat capabilities of leaders such as Hugh Trenchard, Bomber Harris, Herman Goering, Curtis LeMay, and Henry Hap Arnold. Boyne’s views on World War II bombings and air power in the Vietnam War will please many readers—and perhaps shock many others. The Influence of Air Power Upon History is an important book for the public and for the military and is destined to be hotly debated for years to come.",N/A,N/A,en

My Reminiscences,['Rabindranath Tagore'],2023-06-29,['Fiction'],"Rabindranath Tagore, sometimes referred to as the Bard of Bengal, was a poet, composer, and artist active in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. His poetry had a profound impact on Bengali literature—so much so that in 1913 he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Today Tagore is recognized for transforming Bengali art, moving it away from its classical forms by embracing the Bengal Renaissance. Though his artistic output spanned many disciplines, his most famous is perhaps Gitanjali, his collection of poems that he himself later translated to English. His impact on Indian and Bengali letters can be exemplified by the fact that two of his compositions were chosen as national anthems—“Jana Gana Mana” for India, and “Amar Shonar Bangla” for Bangladesh—and that the Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work. In these autobiographical sketches Tagore gives us windows into his childhood, his youth, and his blossoming as a writer and as a lyricist. He stresses that this is not an autobiography, but more like a palimpsest of memories: glimmers and shadows that illustrate his artistic development, not a strict record of his life.",N/A,N/A,en

Our American Cousin,['Tom Taylor'],2023-06-25,['Fiction'],"Our American Cousin is a three-act play written by English playwright Tom Taylor. The play opened in London in 1858 but quickly made its way to the U.S. and premiered at Laura Keene’s Theatre in New York City later that year. It remained popular in the U.S. and England for the next several decades. Its most notable claim to fame, however, is that it was the play U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was watching on April 14, 1865 when he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, who used his knowledge of the script to shoot Lincoln during a more raucous scene. The play is a classic Victorian farce with a whole range of stereotyped characters, business, and many entrances and exits. The plot features a boorish but honest American cousin who travels to the aristocratic English countryside to claim his inheritance, and then quickly becomes swept up in the family’s affairs. An inevitable rescue of the family’s fortunes and of the various damsels in distress ensues. Our American Cousin was originally written as a farce for an English audience, with the laughs coming mostly at the expense of the naive American character. But after it moved to the U.S. it was eventually recast as a comedy where English caricatures like the pompous Lord Dundreary soon became the primary source of hilarity. This early version, published in 1869, contains fewer of that character’s nonsensical adages, which soon came to be known as “Dundrearyisms,” and for which the play eventually gained much of its popular appeal.",N/A,N/A,en

Transport Justice,['Karel Martens'],2016-07-01,['Architecture'],"Transport Justice develops a new paradigm for transportation planning based on principles of justice. Author Karel Martens starts from the observation that for the last fifty years the focus of transportation planning and policy has been on the performance of the transport system and ways to improve it, without much attention being paid to the persons actually using – or failing to use – that transport system. There are far-reaching consequences of this approach, with some enjoying the fruits of the improvements in the transport system, while others have experienced a substantial deterioration in their situation. The growing body of academic evidence on the resulting disparities in mobility and accessibility, have been paralleled by increasingly vocal calls for policy changes to address the inequities that have developed over time. Drawing on philosophies of social justice, Transport Justice argues that governments have the fundamental duty of providing virtually every person with adequate transportation and thus of mitigating the social disparities that have been created over the past decades. Critical reading for transport planners and students of transportation planning, this book develops a new approach to transportation planning that takes people as its starting point, and justice as its end.",N/A,N/A,en
Public Transport,['Peter R. White'],2016-12-01,['Transportation'],"Public Transport provides an accessible introductory text to the field of public transport systems, covering bus, coach, rail, metro, domestic air and taxi modes. The market structure is set out, together with data collection methods. The technology of bus and rail systems is introduced with particular reference to peak capacity and energy consumption. An analysis of cost structures and costing methods leads into a review of pricing concepts and their application. In addition to issues related to urban systems, specific chapters cover rural public transport and the long-distance sector. A concluding chapter examines long-run policy issues, such as likely population changes and scope for substitution of travel. The primary context taken is that of the British Isles, drawing extensively on data such as the National Travel Survey in England. However, the principles and findings are also broadly applicable to countries of similar per capita income and population density. This sixth edition introduces a new chapter on data collection and survey methods for public transport systems in addition to a general update of the text to reflect the latest statistical evidence, research findings and policy changes. Public Transport is an essential textbook for both students in transport and those in related fields.

The Routledge Handbook of Transport Economics,"['Jonathan Cowie', 'Stephen Ison']",2017-08-07,['Business & Economics'],"The Routledge Handbook of Transport Economics offers the first state of the art overview of the discipline of transport economics as it stands today, reflective of key research and policy. Transport is an important area of study and one which is problem rich, stimulating a great deal of debate in areas which impact on everyday lives. Much of this focuses on the practicalities of the modern-day phenomenon of mass movement and all of the issues which surround it. The discipline of economics is central to this debate, and consequently the study and application of transport economics has a chief role to play in seeking to address subjects relating to major transport issues. It can be argued that at the very heart of any transport issue or problem lies the underlying economics of the situation – understand that and you alleviate the problem. Featuring contributions from world-leading scholars and practitioners from across the globe, all of the chapters within this book are written from a practical perspective; theory is applied and developed using real-world examples. The book examines concepts, issues, ideas and practicalities of transport provision in five key topic areas: public transport public transport reform economic development and transport modelling transport and the environment freight transport. A real strength of the book is in linking theory to practice, and hence the ‘economics’ that are examined in this text are not the economics of the abstract, but rather the economics of everyday living. Practical and insightful, this volume is an essential reference for any student or researcher working in all areas of transport provision, ranging from planning, appraisal, regulation and freight; and for all practitioners looking to develop their professional knowledge and who are seeking professional accreditation.",N/A,N/A,en

German Military Vehicles of World War II,['Jean-Denis G.G. Lepage'],2014-11-18,['History'],"This volume presents a cross-section of the most common transport vehicles produced and used by the German army. Tanks plus auxiliary vehicles such as cars, motorcycles, vans, ambulances, trucks and tractors made it possible for the troops to keep moving. These lightly armored or unarmored vehicles--aka ""soft skins""--operated behind the front lines, maintaining supply lines, connecting armies with their home bases, and ultimately determining the outcome of battle. Beginning with the development of military vehicles in the early 1930s, this volume discusses the ways in which this new technology influenced and, to some extent, facilitated Hitler's program of rearmament. Nomenclature, standard equipment, camouflage and the combat roles of the various vehicles are thoroughly examined. Individual vehicle types are arranged and discussed by the following classifications: cars and motorcycles; trucks and tractors; half-tracks and wheeled combat vehicles. Accompanied by well-researched, detailed line drawings, each section deals with a number of individual vehicles, describing their design, manufacture and specific use.",N/A,N/A,en

365 Sports Cars You Must Drive,"['John Lamm', 'Steve Sutcliffe', 'Larry Edsall', 'James Mann', 'Kris Palmer']",2020-10-27,['Transportation'],"365 Sports Cars You Must Drive puts you in the driver's seat of a century's worth of sports car legends (and a few rather less legendary), each presented with a fun and informative profile and fact-and-spec box. It's the ultimate gearhead's bucket list and poses the challenge: How many have you driven? Whoever coined the phrase ""getting there is half the fun"" must have owned a sports car. And the wag who suggested that ""it's the journey not the destination""? Probably driving a Lotus or MG at the time.

Shelby Mustang,['Colin Comer'],2019-10-08,['Transportation'],"Shelby Mustang details the entire story of these fantastic cars, from the early prototypes built in Shelby's Los Angeles shop to today's Ford-engineered high-tech performers. Written by one of the world's foremost authorities on Shelby automobiles, critically acclaimed author Colin Comer, and with a foreword by Lee Iacocca, the American automobile executive credited with the successful development of the Mustang, this is the definitive account of the Shelby. When Ford wanted to toughen up its super-successful new Mustang, they approached Carroll Shelby to give it the performance image it so sorely lacked. Beginning with a 1965 ""K-Code"" 289-cubic-inch-powered Mustang fastback, Shelby applied the same formula that had made his Cobra sports cars such devastating performers both on and off the track: more horsepower, less weight, balanced handling. The GT350 quickly established itself as a bonafide force in SCCA B-Production racing, twisting back roads, and boulevards alike—setting the course for future Shelby Mustangs, like the big-block GT500. Though those original Shelby Mustangs were done by 1970, Ford dusted off its Shelby relationship in 2006 and has been producing high-performance Ford Mustang Shelbys ever since. This is a must-have read for any fan of American performance cars, whether you're a muscle-era original or a 21st-century stormer.",N/A,N/A,en

Seven Pillars of Wisdom,['T. E. Lawrence'],2023-04-15,['Fiction'],"We rely on your support to help us keep producing beautiful, free, and unrestricted editions of literature for the digital age. Will you support our efforts with a donation? Seven Pillars of Wisdom is T. E. Lawrence’s memoir of his involvement in leading a portion of the Arab revolt against the Ottoman empire during World War I. The empire had joined the side of Germany and the Central Powers in the war, and Britain hoped that a successful revolt would take the empire out of the war effort. Britain had also promised the Arabs that, if they were successful, England would recognize a single Arab state. Lawrence convinced the Arab leaders, who had historically not shown a willingness to work together, to join forces in supporting Britain’s strategy in the area. His memoir is part travelogue, part philosophy treatise, and part action novel. It details his movements and actions during his two year involvement, his relationships with the various Arab leaders and men who fought with him, and his thoughts—and doubts—during that time. It’s a gripping tale made famous by the movie Lawrence of Arabia, and one that Winston Churchill called “unsurpassable” as a “narrative of war and adventure.” The manuscript of Seven Pillars of Wisdom has a rich history. Lawrence finished his first draft in 1919 from his notes during the war, but lost most of it when changing trains in England (it was never found). The next year, he started working on a new version from memory that ended up being sixty percent longer than the original. He then edited that version (although it was still a third longer than the original draft), finishing it in early 1922, and had eight copies of it printed to give to friends so they could review it and offer editing suggestions (and to prevent a repeat of losing his only copy). About this time he re-enlisted in the service, but friends convinced him to work on a version he could publish. In 1926, he had a first edition of approximately 200 copies published that included 125 black-and-white and color illustrations from sixteen different artists. The first edition lost money, and it was the only edition published during his lifetime. This edition uses the first edition text and includes all 125 of the original illustrations, including both endpapers.",N/A,N/A,en
Thinking Small,['Andrea Hiott'],2012-01-17,['History'],"Sometimes achieving big things requires the ability to think small. This simple concept was the driving force that propelled the Volkswagen Beetle to become an avatar of American-style freedom, a household brand, and a global icon. The VW Bug inspired the ad men of Madison Avenue, beguiled Woodstock Nation, and has recently been re-imagined for the hipster generation. And while today it is surely one of the most recognizable cars in the world, few of us know the compelling details of this car’s story. In Thinking Small, journalist and cultural historian Andrea Hiott retraces the improbable journey of this little car that changed the world. Andrea Hiott’s wide-ranging narrative stretches from the factory floors of Weimar Germany to the executive suites of today’s automotive innovators, showing how a succession of artists and engineers shepherded the Beetle to market through periods of privation and war, reconstruction and recovery. Henry Ford’s Model T may have revolutionized the American auto industry, but for years Europe remained a place where only the elite drove cars. That all changed with the advent of the Volkswagen, the product of a Nazi initiative to bring driving to the masses. But Hitler’s concept of “the people’s car” would soon take on new meaning. As Germany rebuilt from the rubble of World War II, a whole generation succumbed to the charms of the world’s most huggable automobile. Indeed, the story of the Volkswagen is a story about people, and Hiott introduces us to the men who believed in it, built it, and sold it: Ferdinand Porsche, the visionary Austrian automobile designer whose futuristic dream of an affordable family vehicle was fatally compromised by his patron Adolf Hitler’s monomaniacal drive toward war; Heinrich Nordhoff, the forward-thinking German industrialist whose management innovations made mass production of the Beetle a reality; and Bill Bernbach, the Jewish American advertising executive whose team of Madison Avenue mavericks dreamed up the legendary ad campaign that transformed the quintessential German compact into an outsize worldwide phenomenon. Thinking Small is the remarkable story of an automobile and an idea. Hatched in an age of darkness, the Beetle emerged into the light of a new era as a symbol of individuality and personal mobility—a triumph not of the will but of the imagination.",4.5,N/A,en

Transnationalism in Ancient and Medieval Societies,['Michael C. Howard'],2014-01-10,['History'],"While scholars have long documented the migration of people in ancient and medieval times, they have paid less attention to those who traveled across borders with some regularity. This study of early transnational relations explores the routine interaction of people across the boundaries of empires, tribal confederacies, kingdoms, and city-states, paying particular attention to the role of long-distance trade along the Silk Road and maritime trade routes. It examines the obstacles voyagers faced, including limited travel and communication capabilities, relatively poor geographical knowledge, and the dangers of a fragmented and shifting political landscape, and offers profiles of better-known transnational elites such as the Hellenic scholar Herodotus and the Venetian merchant Marco Polo, as well lesser known servants, merchants, and sailors. By revealing the important political, economic, and cultural role cross-border trade and travel played in ancient society, this work demonstrates that transnationalism is not unique to modern times.

History of the Buccaneers of America,['James Burney'],2007-04-01,['History'],"The last of his published works, History of the Buccaneers of America, published in 1816, is Burney's historical account of the Spanish, English, and French expansion in the New World. In it, he takes a harsh look at those ""miscreants"" from his own country who took up arms against the Spanish explorers for glory, revenge, and gold and stole treasures from the native people. Far from hagiographic, Burney is highly critical of his countrymen's loose morality: he hoped to produce an account that was far more truthful than any previous attempt. Anyone interested in history and the age of explorers will be fascinated by these little-known stories of the day-to-day discovery of the Americas. Englishman JAMES BURNEY (1759-1821) was a rear admiral in the British Royal Navy. He traveled with the famous Captain Cook and wrote a handful of books about the exploration of various parts of the world, including his most famous, Chronological History of the Voyages and Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean (1803).",N/A,N/A,en
The Dragon in the Cockpit,"['Hung-Sying Jing', 'Allen Batteau']",2015-02-28,['Technology & Engineering'],"The purpose of The Dragon in the Cockpit is to enhance the mutual understanding between Western aviation human-factors practitioners and the Chinese aviation community by describing some of the fundamental Chinese cultural characteristics pertinent to the field of flight safety. China’s demand for air transportation is widely expected to increase further, and the Chinese aviation community are now also designing their own commercial aircraft, the COMAC C-919. Consequently, the interactions in the air between the West and China are anticipated to become far more extensive and dynamic. However, due to the multi-faceted nature of Chinese culture, it is sometimes difficult for Westerners to understand Chinese thought and ways, sometimes to the detriment of aviation safety. This book provides crucial insights into Chinese culture and how it manifests itself during flight operations, as well as highlighting ways in which Western technology and Chinese culture clash within the cockpit. Science and technology studies (STS) have demonstrated that sophisticated technologies embed cultural assumptions, usually in subtle ways. These cultural assumptions 'bite back' when the technology is used in an unfamiliar cultural context. By creating the insider’s perspective on the cultural/technological assumptions of the world’s fastest growing industrial economy, this book seeks to minimize the accidents and damage resulting from technological/cultural misunderstandings and misperceptions.",N/A,N/A,en
Pirates and Piracy,['E. Keble Chatterton'],2011-10-20,['Transportation'],"Pirates and acts of piracy were not limited to the Caribbean Sea and the 16th and 17th centuries, as is commonly thought, but ranged far across time and place. Men of adventure who took to pirating in classical times around the Mediterranean are featured in these stirring true tales of high-seas treachery. Gripping narratives of corsairs, freebooters, and privateers—from the Vikings in their longships to the pirates of the Levant and the China Seas—come vividly to life in these swashbuckling, compulsively readable chronicles. Here are riveting accounts of North Sea brigands, Elizabethan seamen, and Turkish pirates; of notorious plunderers like Henry Morgan, Edward (Blackbeard) Teach, and Captain Kidd; as well as the pirates of Borneo and China. Enhanced with sixteen illustrations, the fascinating text recounts as well the stories of daring men who intercepted enemy ships for King and country (and to enrich their own purses).

Rotary-wing Aerodynamics,"['Wieslaw Zenon Stepniewski', 'C. N. Keys']",1984,['Science'],"Recent literature related to rotary-wing aerodynamics has increased geometrically; yet, the field has long been without the benefit of a solid, practical basic text. To fill that void in technical data, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) commissioned the highly respected practicing engineers and authors W. Z. Stepniewski and C. N. Keys to write one. The result: Rotary-Wing Aerodynamics, a clear, concise introduction, highly recommended by U.S. Army experts, that provides students of helicopter and aeronautical engineering with an understanding of the aerodynamic phenomena of the rotor. In addition, it furnishes the tools for quantitative evaluation of both rotor performance and the helicopter as a whole. Now both volumes of the original have been reprinted together in this inexpensive Dover edition. In Volume I: ""Basic Theories of Rotor Aerodynamics,"" the concept of rotary-wing aircraft in general is defined, followed by comparison of the energy effectiveness of helicopters with that of other static-thrust generators in hover, as well as with various air and ground vehicles in forward translation. Volume II: ""Performance Prediction of Helicopters"" offers practical application of the rotary-wing aerodynamic theories discussed in Volume I, and contains complete and detailed performance calculations for conventional single-rotor, winged, and tandem-rotor helicopters. Graduate students with some background in general aerodynamics, or those engaged in other fields of aeronautical or nonaeronautical engineering, will find this an essential and thoroughly practical reference text on basic rotor dynamics. While the material deals primarily with the conventional helicopter and its typical regimes of flight, Rotary-Wing Aerodynamics also provides a comprehensive insight into other fields of rotary-wing aircraft analysis as well.",N/A,N/A,en

The Beautiful and Damned,['F. Scott Fitzgerald'],2023-06-01,['Fiction'],"Anthony Patch, the grandson of a wealthy businessman, spends his youth in idle relaxation expecting to inherit his grandfather’s fortune. But when he meets Gloria, a vibrant young flapper, the two feel an irresistible attraction and quickly get married despite their clashing personalities. The two embark on a lifestyle of Jazz Age living: hard partying, profligate spending, and generally living the high life. But Anthony’s prohibitionist grandfather soon finds out and disowns Anthony, sending their lifestyle crashing down from its former heights to intolerable indignity. Like Fitzgerald’s previous novel, This Side of Paradise, and his next novel, The Great Gatsby, The Beautiful and Damned documents the life of the idle rich in America’s Jazz Age. Both Anthony and Gloria’s characters explore the problem of what one is left to do when one has no other purpose in life. Because Anthony’s expecting a large inheritance, his ambition is muzzled and he feels no need to embark on a career or participate in the betterment of society. Gloria’s main purpose in life was to find a husband; once she’s done that, what’s left except spending money and partying? The relationship between Anthony and Gloria is the explosive propellant that drives the plot. The two are clearly a poor match for each other. While Anthony is an aimless aesthete who expects to inherit wealth and power, Gloria is a self-absorbed socialite mostly banking on her undisputed beauty. Their mutual selfishness leads to constant conflict, and eventually, to mutual dislike. But despite that, the two remain together, locked in to their self-absorption, lack of ambition, and obsession with the past, as Anthony descends into alcoholism and Gloria into desperate middle age. Anthony and Gloria are fairly transparent fictionalizations of Fitzgerald himself and his wife Zelda. Their relationship was famously tumultuous, and parallels Anthony and Gloria’s highs and lows. Fitzgerald himself was born to upper-middle-class wealth and led a aimless youth before turning to the army and to writing; in his later years, he considered himself nothing more than a middling success and turned to writing for Hollywood before totally embracing the alcoholism he had courted since his college days, and that would finally kill him. Zelda, for her part, was a socialite and the canonical “flapper.” Beautiful and bubbly, she enabled the legendarily hard-partying lifestyle that fueled their bitter fights. Her mercurial disposition later led her to being committed to an asylum for schizophrenia.

The importance of early railways in the industrialization of the United States and Europe is a fact all of us are familiar with. To witness the amazing parallel development of the railways in Japan, happening at much the same time as America was connecting its vast hinterland to the East and West coasts, is an eye-opening realization. Early Japanese Railways, tells the fascinating story of the rise of Japanese rail amidst a period of rapid modernization during Japan's Meiji era. Leaving behind centuries of stagnation and isolation, Japan would emerge into the 20th century as a leading modern industrialized state. The development of the railways was a significant factor in the cultural and technological development of Japan during this pivotal period. Free's rare photographic and historical materials concerning Japan's early railways, including a print showing the miniature steam engine brought to Japan by Admiral Perry aboard his ""Black Ships"" to demonstrate American superiority, combine to form a richly detailed account that will appeal to students of Japanese history and railway buffs alike. This one-of-a-kind book, Early Japanese Railways 1853–1914, illuminates for non-Japanese-speaking readers the early history of Japanese railroads and in the process the fascinating story of Japan's prewar industrial modernization.

Acting on it, I jumped out of bed, slipped on a dressing-gown over pyjamas, put on shoes, and went out of my cabin into the hall near the saloon. Here was a steward leaning against the staircase, probably waiting until those in the smoke-room above had gone to bed and he could put out the lights. I said, ""Why have we stopped?"" ""I don't know, sir,"" he replied, ""but I don't suppose it is anything much."" ""Well,"" I said, ""I am going on deck to see what it is,"" and started towards the stairs. He smiled indulgently at me as I passed him, and said, ""All right, sir, but it is mighty cold up there."" I am sure at that time he thought I was rather foolish to go up with so little reason, and I must confess I felt rather absurd for not remaining in the cabin: it seemed like making a needless fuss to walk about the ship in a dressing-gown. But it was my first trip across the sea; I had enjoyed every minute of it and was keenly alive to note every new experience; and certainly to stop in the middle of the sea with a propeller dropped seemed sufficient reason for going on deck. And yet the steward, with his fatherly smile, and the fact that no one else was about the passages or going upstairs to reconnoitre, made me feel guilty in an undefined way of breaking some code of a ship's régime—an Englishman's fear of being thought ""unusual,"" perhaps! I climbed the three flights of stairs, opened the vestibule door leading to the top deck, and stepped out into an atmosphere that cut me, clad as I was, like a knife. Walking to the starboard side, I peered over and saw the sea many feet[...]"".",N/A,N/A,en
Amelia Earhart,['Lori Van Pelt'],2025-08-22,['Biography & Autobiography'],"A exciting new biography of America's first lady of flight. As a tomboy growing up in Kansas, Amelia Earhart delighted in trying new and risky things, once even building a roller-coaster in her grandparents' backyard. In her 20s she fell in love with flight while watching an aerobatics exhibition and grew even more enthralled when she took her first airplane ride. At age 24 she earned her pilot's wings and 1928 took part in the transatlantic ""Friendship"" flight. Her willowy build, wholesome smile, and tousled blonde hair invited comparison to the celebrated pilot Charles Lindbergh, and ""Lady Lindy"" charmed the public with her unassuming manner. Lori Van Pelt's Amelia Earhart: The Sky's No Limit takes readers through Earhart's career triumphs and tragedies.

Mercedes-Benz S-Class 1972-2013,['James Taylor'],2013-12-15,['Transportation'],"Ever since their introduction in 1972, the S-Class saloons from Mercedes-Benz have been considered the pinnacle of automotive excellence. For most of that time, ownership of an S-Class - at least, of a reasonably recent one - has been symbolic of material success and of restrained yet impeccable good taste. Several other car makers have nibbled at the edges of the S-Class market, but none has produced a viable and lasting alternative to the big Benz. Mercedes-Benz S-Class 1972-2013 charts the evolution and success of the series, from the W116 model, the first to be designed from the ground up as a large luxury saloon, through to the C126 coupe, one of the all-time Mercedes-Benz classic designs.Topics covered include: development and production of the W126 saloons and classic W126 coupes; the W140 saloons in the 1990s; the 140 coupes, the W220 models and the elegant 215 coupes; the W221 models, introduced at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in 2005; the C216 coupes and the future of Mercedes-Benz S-Class.

China's Future Nuclear Submarine Force,['Andrew S. Erickson'],2007,['History'],"One of the key concerns of naval strategists and planners today is the nature of the Chinese geostrategic challenge. Conceding that no one can know for certain China s intentions in terms of future conflict, the editors of this hot-topic book argue that the trajectory of Chinese nuclear propulsion for submarines may be one of the best single indicators of China s ambitions of global military power. Nuclear submarines, with their unparalleled survivability, remain ideal platforms for persistent operations in far-flung sea areas and offer an efficient means for China to project power. This collection of essays presents the latest thinking of leading experts on the emergence of a modern nuclear submarine fleet in China. Each contribution is packed with authoritative data and cogent analysis. The book has been compiled by four professors and analysts at the U.S. Naval War College who are co-founders of the college s recently established China Maritime Studies Institute. Given the opaque nature of China s undersea warfare development, readers will benefit from this penetrating investigation that considers the potential impact of even the most revolutionary changes in Chinese nuclear submarine capabilities. The editors believe that to ignore such possibilities would be the height of strategic folly and represent inexcusable negligence in terms of U.S. national defense. Anyone who is interested in the future of the U.S. Navy and the defense of the United States will find this book to be essential reading.",N/A,N/A,en

Mallard,['Don Hale'],2005,['History'],"In July 1938, the superbly streamlined A4 Pacific class steam locomotive ""Mallard"" set a world speed record on the East Coast main line of 126mph, a record which still stands. Now, some 65 years on, Don Hale tells the full story of how the record came to be broken. It's a tale that goes back to the late 19th century, when the rival railway companies first began to vie with one another to set speed records between London and Scotland. It charts the technological development of the steam engine through the early decades of the 20th century into a hugely powerful and truly locomotive machine. And above all, it focuses on the singular and larger-than-life character of Sir Nigel Gresley, Mallard's designer and one of the most gifted engineers Britain has ever produced. In an account that includes interviews with surviving crew members and their relatives, the book sets the scene for the big day itself, and follows hour by hour the nailbiting attempt to break the record, as the giant ""Blue Streak"" thunders up the main line through the heart of England and into the record books.",N/A,N/A,en

Aviation Security Management,['Andrew R. Thomas'],2008-10-30,['Business & Economics'],"Because of 9/11, there is universal recognition that aviation security is a deadly serious business. Still, around the world today, the practice of aviation security is rooted in a hodgepodge of governmental rules, industry traditions, and local idiosyncrasies. In fact, nearly seven years after the largest single attack involving the air transport industry, there remains no viable framework in place to lift aviation security practice out of the mishmash that currently exists. It is the ambitious intent of Aviation Security Management to change that. The goals of this set are nothing less than to make flying safer, to make transporting goods by air safer, and to lay the foundation for the professionalization of this most important field. This dynamic set showcases the most current trends, issues, ideas, and practices in aviation security management, especially as the field evolves in the context of globalization and advances in technology. Written by leading academic thinkers, practitioners, and former and current regulators in the field, the three volumes highlight emerging and innovative practices, illustrated with examples from around the world. Volume 1 takes a penetrating look at the overall framework in which aviation security management has taken place in the past and will likely do so in the foreseeable future. It covers the major areas of focus for anyone in the aviation security business, and it provides a basis for educational programs. Volume 2 delves into the emerging issues affecting aviation security managers right now. Volume 3: Perspectives on Aviation Security Management covers the full spectrum of international aviation security-related issues. It will serve as part of the foundation for the next generation of research in the area in both a business and cultural context. Collectively, these volumes represent the state of the art in the field today and constitute an essential resource for anyone practicing, studying, teaching, or researching aviation security management.",N/A,N/A,en

Tupolev Tu-16 Badger,"['Yefim Gordon', 'Vladimir Rigmant']",2004-06-21,['Tu-16 Badger (Bomber)'],"The establishment of NATO posed the need for the Soviet war machine to create a fast jet bomber capable of reaching targets throughout Western Europe and combatting the carrier task forces with which the US Navy could throw its weight around the world. The basic Tu-16 which first flew in the mid-1950s was developed into nearly 50 versions adopted for various roles, including nuclear-capable bombers, anti-shipping missile strike aircraft, torpedo-bombers and minelayers, numerous reconnaissance and ECM variants, assorted development aircraft for testing new engines, avionics and systems. The Tu-16 even found civil uses as a fast mailplane and a weather research/rainmaking aircraft! The Badger, as the bomber was known to the West, served as the basis for the Soviet Union's first jet airliner, the Tu-104. The nearly 1,500 Tu-16s built in the Soviet Union were an important factor in preventing all-out military confrontation between the East and the West. Since the mid-1950s and until the 1980s the Badger has been a regular picture on the pages of the Western press, snooping around Western naval groups every now and then. The type also had its share of 'hot' wars, getting its baptism of fire in the Six-Day War of 1967. Apart from three factories in the USSR, the Tu-16 was built under license in China as the H-6 and remains in service with the People's Liberation Army Air Force. Other foreign users were Egypt, Indonesia and Iraq.

"Streets, Railroads, and the Great Strike of 1877",['David O. Stowell'],1999-06,['History'],"For one week in late July of 1877, America shook with anger and fear as a variety of urban residents, mostly working class, attacked railroad property in dozens of towns and cities. The Great Strike of 1877 was one of the largest and most violent urban uprisings in American history. Whereas most historians treat the event solely as a massive labor strike that targeted the railroads, David O. Stowell examines America's predicament more broadly to uncover the roots of this rebellion. He studies the urban origins of the Strike in three upstate New York cities—Buffalo, Albany, and Syracuse. He finds that locomotives rumbled through crowded urban spaces, sending panicked horses and their wagons careening through streets. Hundreds of people were killed and injured with appalling regularity. The trains also disrupted street traffic and obstructed certain forms of commerce. For these reasons, Stowell argues, The Great Strike was not simply an uprising fueled by disgruntled workers. Rather, it was a grave reflection of one of the most direct and damaging ways many people experienced the Industrial Revolution. ""Through meticulously crafted case studies . . . the author advances the thesis that the strike had urban roots, that in substantial part it represented a community uprising. . . .A particular strength of the book is Stowell's description of the horrendous accidents, the toll in human life, and the continual disruption of craft, business, and ordinary movement engendered by building railroads into the heart of cities.""—Charles N.

Ghost Train to the Eastern Star,['Paul Theroux'],2008,['Transportation'],"Thirty years after the epic journey chronicled in his classic work The Great Railway Bazaar, the world s most acclaimed travel writer re-creates his 25,000-mile journey through eastern Europe, central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, China, Japan, and Siberia. Half a lifetime ago, Paul Theroux virtually invented the modern travel narrative by recounting his grand tour by train through Asia. In the three decades since, the world he recorded in that book has undergone phenomenal change. The Soviet Union has collapsed and China has risen; India booms while Burma smothers under dictatorship; Vietnam flourishes in the aftermath of the havoc America was unleashing on it the last time Theroux passed through. And no one is better able to capture the texture, sights, smells, and sounds of that changing landscape than Theroux. Theroux s odyssey takes him from eastern Europe, still hung-over from communism, through tense but thriving Turkey into the Caucasus, where Georgia limps back toward feudalism while its neighbor Azerbaijan revels in oil-fueled capitalism. Theroux is firsthand witness to it all, traveling as the locals doby stifling train, rattletrap bus, illicit taxi, and mud-caked footencountering adventures only he could have: from the literary (sparring with the incisive Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk) to the dissolute (surviving a week-long bender on the Trans-Siberian Railroad). And wherever he goes, his omnivorous curiosity and unerring eye for detail never fail to inspire, enlighten, inform, and entertain. PAUL THEROUX was born in Medford, Massachusetts, in 1941 and published his first novel, Waldo, in 1967. His fiction includes The Mosquito Coast, My Secret History, My Other Life, Kowloon Tong, Blinding Light, and most recently, The Elephanta Suite. His highly acclaimed travel books include Riding the Iron Rooster, The Great Railway Bazaar, The Old Patagonian Express, Fresh Air Fiend, and Dark Star Safari. He has been the guest editor of The Best American Travel Writing and is a frequent contributor to various magazines, including The New Yorker. He lives in Hawaii and on Cape Cod.""",3.5,N/A,en

The Wright Company,['Edward J. Roach'],2014-01-21,['Business & Economics'],"Fresh from successful flights before royalty in Europe, and soon after thrilling hundreds of thousands of people by flying around the Statue of Liberty, in the fall of 1909 Wilbur and Orville Wright decided the time was right to begin manufacturing their airplanes for sale. Backed by Wall Street tycoons, including August Belmont, Cornelius Vanderbilt III, and Andrew Freedman, the brothers formed the Wright Company. The Wright Company trained hundreds of early aviators at its flight schools, including Roy Brown, the Canadian pilot credited with shooting down Manfred von Richtofen — the “Red Baron”— during the First World War; and Hap Arnold, the commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces during the Second World War. Pilots with the company’s exhibition department thrilled crowds at events from Winnipeg to Boston, Corpus Christi to Colorado Springs. Cal Rodgers flew a Wright Company airplane in pursuit of the $50,000 Hearst Aviation Prize in 1911. But all was not well in Dayton, a city that hummed with industry, producing cash registers, railroad cars, and many other products. The brothers found it hard to transition from running their own bicycle business to being corporate executives responsible for other people’s money. Their dogged pursuit of enforcement of their 1906 patent — especially against Glenn Curtiss and his company — helped hold back the development of the U.S. aviation industry. When Orville Wright sold the company in 1915, more than three years after his brother’s death, he was a comfortable man — but his company had built only 120 airplanes at its Dayton factory and Wright Company products were not in the U.S. arsenal as war continued in Europe. Edward Roach provides a fascinating window into the legendary Wright Company, its place in Dayton, its management struggles, and its effects on early U.S. aviation.",N/A,N/A,en

Two Wheels Good,['Jody Rosen'],2022-05-24,['History'],"A panoramic revisionist portrait of the nineteenth-century invention that is transforming the twenty-first-century world “Excellent . . . calls to mind Bill Bryson, John McPhee, Rebecca Solnit.”—The New York Times Book Review (Editors’ Choice) ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New Yorker The bicycle is a vestige of the Victorian era, seemingly at odds with our age of smartphones and ride-sharing apps and driverless cars. Yet we live on a bicycle planet. Across the world, more people travel by bicycle than any other form of transportation. Almost anyone can learn to ride a bike—and nearly everyone does. In Two Wheels Good, journalist and critic Jody Rosen reshapes our understanding of this ubiquitous machine, an ever-present force in humanity’s life and dream life—and a flash point in culture wars—for more than two hundred years. Combining history, reportage, travelogue, and memoir, Rosen’s book sweeps across centuries and around the globe, unfolding the bicycle’s saga from its invention in 1817 to its present-day renaissance as a “green machine,” an emblem of sustainability in a world afflicted by pandemic and climate change. Readers meet unforgettable characters: feminist rebels who steered bikes to the barricades in the 1890s, a prospector who pedaled across the frozen Yukon to join the Klondike gold rush, a Bhutanese king who races mountain bikes in the Himalayas, a cycle-rickshaw driver who navigates the seething streets of the world’s fastest-growing megacity, astronauts who ride a floating bicycle in zero gravity aboard the International Space Station. Two Wheels Good examines the bicycle’s past and peers into its future, challenging myths and clichés while uncovering cycling’s connection to colonial conquest and the gentrification of cities. But the book is also a love letter: a reflection on the sensual and spiritual pleasures of bike riding and an ode to an engineering marvel—a wondrous vehicle whose passenger is also its engine.",N/A,N/A,en

As soon as the Soviet government got wind of this program, it tasked the national aircraft industry with an even more ambitious project: the Soviet Union was to create an SST entirely on its own v and ahead of the West; this was a matter of national prestige. Predictably, Andrey N. Tupolev received the assignment to create the airliner that would place the Soviet Union in the lead. At the cost of a tremendous research and development effort, the target was met v designated Tu-144 (and dubbed, rather mockingly, Concordski by the West), the Soviet SST took to the air in December 1968 ahead of its Anglo- French counterpart.

Also depicted are a Roman trireme, a Viking longship, a sixteenth-century caravel, an East Indiaman of 1750, an early nineteenth-century brigantine, a New Bedford whaling bark, and dozens of lesser-known vessels, among them the galleass, carrack, buss, and flute. Henry B. Culver, well-known authority on naval history, has provided a detailed, meticulously researched text for each vessel, describing the materials and details of construction, how the ship's design matched its function, the period in which the vessel flourished, romance and lore surrounding the craft, and more.

An ISIS terrorist planned to kill more than 500 people. He would have succeeded except for three American friends who refused to give in to fear. On August 21, 2015, Ayoub El-Khazzani boarded train #9364 in Brussels, bound for Paris. There could be no doubt about his mission: he had an AK-47, a pistol, a box cutter, and enough ammunition to obliterate every passenger on board. Slipping into the bathroom in secret, he armed his weapons. Another major ISIS attack was about to begin. Khazzani wasn't expecting Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, and Spencer Stone. Stone was a martial arts enthusiast and airman first class in the US Air Force, Skarlatos was a member of the Oregon National Guard, and all three were fearless. But their decision, to charge the gunman, then overpower him even as he turned first his gun, then his knife, on Stone, depended on a lifetime of loyalty, support, and faith. Their friendship was forged as they came of age together in California: going to church, playing paintball, teaching each other to swear, and sticking together when they got in trouble at school. Years later, that friendship would give all of them the courage to stand in the path of one of the world's deadliest terrorist organizations.

Dana shipped out of Boston on the brig Pilgrim bound for California to bring back cow hides, presumably for the leather industry around Boston. ""Two Years Before the Mast"" is a graphic, sometimes chilling, picture of what life was like for seamen on a merchant ship in the 1800s. They were no better than slaves, with life and death being subject to the whims of the captain. Their pay was small and sometimes they were forced to spend it in what amounted to a company store. It was possible to go on a two year voyage and wind up owing the shipping company money. The condition under which this labor was performed stretches the imagination.

The Age of the Galley,['Robert Gardiner'],1995,['History'],"Part of Conway's History of the Ship series, this volume deals with Mediterranean developments from the earliest re corded history, but concentrates on the oared vessel in all its varieties from pre-classical times, through the eras of the trireme and its many-banked successors, to the final extinction of the last galley fleets in the 18th century. Besides the ships themselves, background chapters cover such issues as navigation and shiphandling and rowing systems.",N/A,N/A,en
Data Driven,['Karen Levy'],2024-06-18,['Business & Economics'],"A behind-the-scenes look at how digital surveillance is affecting the trucking way of life Long-haul truckers are the backbone of the American economy, transporting goods under grueling conditions and immense economic pressure. Truckers have long valued the day-to-day independence of their work, sharing a strong occupational identity rooted in a tradition of autonomy. Yet these workers increasingly find themselves under many watchful eyes. Data Driven examines how digital surveillance is upending life and work on the open road, and raises crucial questions about the role of data collection in broader systems of social control. Karen Levy takes readers inside a world few ever see, painting a bracing portrait of one of the last great American frontiers. Federal regulations now require truckers to buy and install digital monitors that capture data about their locations and behaviors. Intended to address the pervasive problem of trucker fatigue by regulating the number of hours driven each day, these devices support additional surveillance by trucking firms and other companies. Traveling from industry trade shows to law offices and truck-stop bars, Levy reveals how these invasive technologies are reconfiguring industry relationships and providing new tools for managerial and legal control—and how truckers are challenging and resisting them. Data Driven contributes to an emerging conversation about how technology affects our work, institutions, and personal lives, and helps to guide our thinking about how to protect public interests and safeguard human dignity in the digital age.",N/A,N/A,en

The Race for Hitler's X-planes,['John Christopher'],2013,['History'],"During World War 2, Hitler's engineers had pioneered an incredible array of futuristic secret weapons, from the Me 262, the first operational jet fighter, to the deadly V2 inter-continental ballistic missile. With the Third Reich shattered and lying in ruins, in the summer of 1945, the Allies launched a frantic race to grab what they saw as the justifiable spoils of war. The Americans and Russians in particular were anxious to secure not only the aircraft and the research and production facilities, but also the key German scientists and engineers. This Nazi technology would define the balance of power in the phoney peace of the Cold War era, launching an arms race that shaped our modern world for decades to come. But what of Britain's role in this supermarket sweep. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes tells the untold story of the British mission to Germany.",N/A,N/A,en

Multibody Systems Approach to Vehicle Dynamics,"['Michael Blundell', 'Damian Harty']",2004,['Technology & Engineering'],"Multibody Systems Approach to Vehicle Dynamics aims to bridge a gap between the subject of classical vehicle dynamics and the general-purpose computer-based discipline known as multibody systems analysis (MBS). The book begins by describing the emergence of MBS and providing an overview of its role in vehicle design and development. This is followed by separate chapters on the modeling, analysis, and post-processing capabilities of a typical simulation software; the modeling and analysis of the suspension system; tire force and moment generating characteristics and subsequent modeling of these in an MBS simulation; and the modeling and assembly of the rest of the vehicle, including the anti-roll bars and steering systems. The final two chapters deal with the simulation output and interpretation of results, and a review of the use of active systems to modify the dynamics in modern passenger cars. This book intended for a wide audience including not only undergraduate, postgraduate and research students working in this area, but also practicing engineers in industry who require a reference text dealing with the major relevant areas within the discipline.",4.5,N/A,en
