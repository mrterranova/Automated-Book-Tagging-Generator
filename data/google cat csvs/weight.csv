The Weight of Mass Or the Mess of Weight,['U. Gat'],1987,['International System of Units (SI)'],"The ambiguity of the term weight, meaning either the force of gravity or mass, is analyzed. It is shown that through the historical development of technical understanding the distinction between mass and force of gravity has been obscure. The confusion is further aggravated by the use of units with the same name for either mass or force. Contemporary technology is vulnerable to errors and misunderstandings due to the ambiguity of the term weight. SI uses clearly distinguishing unit names for mass and force, that is, kilogram and newton. It is recommended that the term weight be avoided and if used be restricted to mean force of gravity.",N/A,N/A

Weight Loss Technique for Measurement of Wear of Polymeric Orthopedic Implants,"['JL. Lower', 'HC. Price']",1989,['Atmospheric pressure'],"Low wear properties of ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and carbon reinforced polyethylene prosthesis require 0.1-mg accuracy for a valid quantitative wear test. Buoyancy of air displaced by the volume of the wear specimen will have an influence on the specimen's weight. Density variation of air due to barometric pressure, temperature, and relative humidity during a wear test will alter the succeeding weight measurements. The average amount of wear debris is very small compared to the total mass of the wear specimen, approximately 0.005 to 0.05% or 1 to 2 mg per million cycles for a 4000 to 22 000-mg component, respectively. Displaced air mass variation for a volume equivalent to a wear component over a test period can be as high as 1 mg. Buoyancy compensation should be considered for addition to ASTM F 732 (Practice for Reciprocating Pin on Flat Evaluation of Friction and Wear Properties of Polymeric Materials for Use in Total Joint Prostheses) and any test procedure utilizing weight loss measurement for wear.",N/A,N/A

Objective Assessment of Fabric Handle in Fabrics Treated with Flame Retardants,"['JO. Kim', 'BL. Slaten']",1996,['Drapeability'],"Flame retardant finishes generally affect fabric handle, the tactile sensations resulting from fabric-skin contact. The subjectivity involved in the measurement of fabric handle has posed a major problem in the objective evaluation of the fabric's surface characteristics and comfort. This study investigated the effects of various flame-resistant (FR) finishes on changes in fabric handle utilizing a simple measurement technique. The nozzle extraction handle measurement method can be used as an effective objective measurement tool for textile and apparel industries to detect changes in the overall handle resulting from the processing of fibers, fabrics, or finishes. Peak handle force and slope near the peak force serve as variables to reflect overall handle. The relationships of fabric handle values to selective properties (weight, thickness, flexural rigidity, and drape coefficient) indicate that the fabric handle measured by the extraction method correlates most closely with the drape coefficient.",N/A,N/A

Smashing the Scale: An Obese Actor's Journey Through Facing Fear and Exorcising the Demons of Fatshaming Resulting in a Newfound Freedom from Shame,['Matthew Jeremy Stepan'],2021,['Acting'],"In October of 2020, I presented Another F-Word, an original digital performance that explored issues surrounding living with obesity to unpack and liberate myself from a lifetime of internalized fatshaming, empower other obese people, and confront audiences about their role in marginalizing and oppressing overweight people. Public livestreaming of Another F-Word constituted the final element of my culminating project in partial fulfillment of the MFA in Television, Film and Theatre/Acting Option at California State University, Los Angeles. I performed this project along with undergraduate theatre majors Mignon DeLarre and Giselle ""Gigi"" Rios and MFA classmate Jeremy Leochner, directed by Adam Ferguson, alumnus of the same MFA in Television, Film and Theatre/Acting Option program.This project report chronicles the impetus, development, rehearsal, and performance of this production, including the challenges of performing a heartbreaking autobiographical script and doing so via new livestreaming technology in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, this report concludes with reflections on lessons learned through this process.",N/A,N/A

Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods,['Tina G. Butcher'],2023,['Area'],"This handbook has been prepared as a procedural guide for the compliance testing of net content statements on packaged goods. Compliance testing of packaged goods is the determination of the conformance results of packaging, distribution, and sale of commodities to specific legal requirements for net content declarations. This handbook has been developed primarily for the use of state, local, and some federal officials. However, it should be useful to commercial and industrial establishments areas of packaging, distribution, and sale of commodities. NIST has statutory responsibility for ""cooperation with states in securing uniformity of weights and measures laws and methods of inspection and publishes this and other NIST Handbooks in partial fulfillment of this responsibility. This 2023 edition includes amendments made though the Committee on Laws and Regulations of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) with technical guidance from the Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and input from weights and measures officials and industry representatives. These amendments were adopted by the NCWM at its 107th Annual Meeting in July 2022. There may be years where there are no changes to this NIST Handbook 133; therefore, it would not be published on an annual basis in such instances. In conducting compliance testing, the conversion of measured quantity values between systems of measurement (e.g., from the metric system to the U.S. customary system) should be handled with careful regard to the implied correspondence between measurement accuracy and the number of digits displayed. For all conversions, the number of significant figures retained should be congruous with the accuracy of the corresponding measurement. For this edition of NIST Handbook 133, all quantity values obtained from devices or through test procedures have been rounded to two significant digits (e.g., 2.5 cm to 1.0 in), or to a precision level applicable to the test equipment (e.g., 200 kPa for 25 psi or 35 MPs for 5000 psi).",N/A,N/A

A Method for Estimating Weight in Children from Femoral Midshaft Diameter and Age,"['PW. Sciulli', 'RO. Pfau']",1994,['Anthropology'],"In this investigation, we relate transverse midshaft diameter of the femur, age, and weight in a sample of 183 children from Central Ohio. Age and femur diameter considered separately are similar in their ability to predict weight. Considering all sex and ancestry groupings (male, female, white, black), age explains between 90% to 96.8% of the variation in weight while femur diameter explains between 93% to 97.4%. However, estimates of individual weight from age or femur diameter have very large 95% prediction limits.",N/A,N/A
