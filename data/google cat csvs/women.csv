Women in Ancient Greece,['Sue Blundell'],1995,['History'],"This is an exploration of an often-overlooked group in ancient Greece: women. Though they played little or no public role, women were an integral part of Greek society and it is impossible to gain a full and balanced idea of that society without considering their experience alongside that of men.",N/A,N/A

Women in Iran from 1800 to the Islamic Republic,"['Lois Beck', 'Guity Nashat']",2004,['History'],"The role of women in Iran has often been downplayed or obscured, particularly in the modern era. This volume demonstrates that women have long played important roles in different facets of Iranian society. Together with its companion, Women in Iran from the Rise of Islam to 1800, this volume completes a two-book project on the central importance of Iranian women from pre-Islamic times through the creation and establishment of the Islamic Republic. It includes essays from various disciplines by prominent scholars who examine women's roles in politics, society, and culture and the rise and development of the women's movement before and during the Islamic Republic. Several contributors address the issue of regional, ethnic, linguistic, and tribal diversity in Iran, which has long contained complex, heterogenous societies.",N/A,N/A
History Matters,['Judith M.

Mrs. Dalloway,['Virginia Woolf'],1925,['Fiction'],"Heralded as Virginia Woolf's greatest novel, this is a vivid portrait of a single day in a woman's life. When we meet her, Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway is preoccupied with the last-minute details of party preparation while in her mind she is something much more than a perfect society hostess. As she readies her house, she is flooded with remembrances of faraway times. And, met with the realities of the present, Clarissa reexamines the choices that brought her there, hesitantly looking ahead to the unfamiliar work of growing old. ""Mrs. Dalloway was the first novel to split the atom. If the novel before Mrs. Dalloway aspired to immensities of scope and scale, to heroic journeys across vast landscapes, with Mrs. Dalloway Virginia Woolf insisted that it could also locate the enormous within the everyday; that a life of errands and party-giving was every bit as viable a subject as any life lived anywhere; and that should any human act in any novel seem unimportant, it has merely been inadequately observed. The novel asan art form has not been the same since. ""Mrs. Dalloway also contains some of the most beautiful, complex, incisive and idiosyncratic sentences ever written in English, and that alone would be reason enough to read it. It is one of the most moving, revolutionary artworks of the twentieth century."" --Michael Cunningham, author of The Hours",N/A,N/A
Sexual Politics,['Kate Millett'],2000,['Health & Fitness'],"Praised and denounced when it was first published in 1970, Sexual Politics not only explored history but also became part of it. Kate Millett's groundbreaking book fueled feminism's second wave, giving voice to the anger of a generation while documenting the inequities -- neatly packaged in revered works of literature and art -- of a complacent and unrepentant society. Sexual Politics laid the foundation for subsequent feminist scholarship by showing how cultural discourse reflects a systematized subjugation and exploitation of women. Millett demonstrates in detail how patriarchy's attitudes and systems penetrate literature, philosophy, psychology, and politics. Her incendiary work rocked the foundations of the literary canon by castigating time-honored classics -- from D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover to Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead -- for their use of sex to degrade and undermine women. A new introduction to this edition draws attention to some of the forms patriarchy has taken recently in consolidating its oppressive and dangerous control.",N/A,N/A
Woman at Point Zero,['Nawāl Saʻdāwī'],1983,['Fiction'],"So begins Firdaus' story, leading to her grimy Cairo prison cell, where she welcomes her death sentence as a relief from her pain and suffering.

Desperate and alone, she takes drastic action. -- Publisher description.",N/A,N/A

Fireweed,['Gerda Lerner'],2002,['Biography & Autobiography'],"In Fireweed, Gerda Lerner, a pioneer and leading scholar in women's history, tells her story of moral courage and commitment to social change with a novelist's skill and a historian's command of context. Lerner's memoir focuses on the formative experiences that made her an activist for social justice before her academic career began. The child of a well-to-do Viennese Jewish family, she was still a teenager when a fascist regime came to power in 1934, and she became involved in the underground resistance movement. The Nazi takeover of Austria cast her into prison, then forced her and her family into exile; she alone was able to leave Europe. Once in the United States, she experienced the harshness of the Depression and despair over the fate of her family. Still, she persisted in adapting to the new culture and to becoming a writer. Here she met and married her life-long partner, Carl Lerner, a film editor and director. Together they become deeply involved in left-wing activities, from struggling to unionize the film industry and resisting the blacklist in Hollywood to community organizing for peace, for an interracial civil rights movement, and for better schools in New York City. Lerner insists that her decades of grassroots organizing largely account for the theoretical insights she was later able to bring to the development of women's history. In Fireweed, Lerner presents her life in the context of the major historical events of the twentieth century and the repression of dissent. Hers is a gripping story about surviving hardship and summoning the courage to live according to one's convictions. Author note: Gerda Lerner, a past president of the Organization of American Historians, is Robinson-Edwards Professor of History, Emerita, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her eleven books in history include Creation of Patriarchy, Creation of Feminist Consciousness, Why History Matters, and Black Women in White America: A Documentary History.",N/A,N/A

The Forsyte Saga,['John Galsworthy'],1999,['Fiction'],"The three novels which make up The Forsyte Saga chronicle the ebbing social power of the commerical upper-middle class Forsyte family between 1886 and 1920. Soames Forsyte is the brilliantly portrayed central figure, a Victorian who outlives the age, and whose baffled passion for his beautiful but unresponsive wife Irene reverberates throughout the saga. Written with both compassion and ironic detachment, Galsworthy's masterly narrative examines not only the family's fortunes but also the wider developments within society, particularly the changing position of women in an intensely competitive male world. Above all, Galsworthy is concerned with the conflict at the heart of English culture between the soulless materialism of wealth and property and the humane instincts of love, beauty, and art.",N/A,N/A

A través de las peripecias vitales de estos personajes, Chang, con un estilo autentico, objetivo y estremecedor sin caer en el melodrama ni el revanchismo, hace un repaso a los grandes hechos y tragedias que ha vivido china en el último siglo. El ejemplo moral de la familia de la autora, muy unida a pesar de las contrariedades -su padre es uno de los personajes más llamativos de todo el libro por su integridad y fidelidad a unos ideales hasta el fin, a pesar de las agónicas dificultades por las que pasara, hace que la novela tenga un mensaje positivo y esperanzador. Además, la autora permite que sean esas experiencias personales -sin disquisiciones teóricas ni lamentos- las que reflejen con exactitud la sufrida historia colectiva de todo un pueblo. Por encima de los sufrimientos padecidos, la mayoría inhumanos, Jung Chang deja constancia de la fortaleza e integridad de gran parte del pueblo chino: rodeada de sufrimiento, muerte y desolación, había contemplado la indescriptible capacidad humana para sobrevivir y buscar la felicidad.",2,N/A

Inventing Subjects,['Himani Bannerji'],2001,['Social Science'],"This book is a collection of essays written from a Marxist-feminist perspective, seeking to make a contribution in the field of historical sociology. The essays speak of the different ways in which social subjects and their agencies have been constructed and represented in the context of the development of colonial hegemony and socio-cultural formations in India. The book primarily focuses, through four essays, on the constructive proposals for social subjectivities and agencies of Bengali middle-class women, by both the indigenous and the colonial elite. The remaining two essays speak of the invention or construction of India as an ideological category for ruling, signalling towards a colonially ascribed identity.The essays capture the fluidity and complexity of subject construction or formation, and read moral regulations and culture in terms of a hegemonic process. They range from middle-class Bengali women s attempts at self-fashioning, to the colonial ideological reflexes within which their projects are articulated. Patriarchy and gender organization are treated here as more than women s problems , as essentially constitutive dimensions of hegemony, no matter aspired to by whom.Himani Bannerji is an Associate Professor of Sociology at York University, Toronto, Canada. She is the author of The Dark Side of the Nation: Essays on Multiculturalism, Nationalism and Racism (2000) and The Mirror of Class: Essays on Bengali Theatre (1998). She has edited Returning the Gaze: Essays on Racism, Feminism and Politics (1993), and co-edited Of Property and Propriety: The Role of Gender and Class in Imperialism and Nationalism (2001).Bannerji challenges many deep-seated prejudices about colonial discourse, and retells the history of India, particularly of colonized Bengal from the clear viewpoint of an educated Indian, aware of her status as a citizen of a doubly colonized discourse.The Statesman",N/A,N/A

The essays collected in this volume speak to interpretative challenges common to all fields of women's and gender history--that is, how best to uncover the experiences of ordinary people from archives formed mainly by and about elite males, and how to combine social histories of lived experiences with cultural histories of gendered discourses and identities. The collection focuses on Western Europe in the Middle Ages but offers some consideration of medieval Islam and Byzantium, opening these fields for further research. The Handbook is structured into seven sections: Christian, Jewish, and Muslim thought; law in theory and practice; domestic life and material culture; labour, land, and economy; bodies and sexualities; gender and holiness; and the interplay of continuity and change throughout the medieval period. This Handbook contains material from some of the foremost scholars in this field, and will not only serve as the major reference text in the area of medieval and gender studies, but will also provide the agenda for future new research""--Publisher description.",N/A,N/A

Wittgenstein's Mistress,['David Markson'],1990,['Fiction'],"Wittgenstein's Mistress is a novel unlike anything David Markson--or anyone else--has ever written before. It is the story of a woman who is convinced--and, astonishingly, will ultimately convince the reader as well--that she is the only person left on earth. Presumably she is mad. And yet so appealing is her character, and so witty and seductive her narrative voice, that we will follow her hypnotically as she unloads the intellectual baggage of a lifetime in a series of irreverent meditations on everything and everybody from Brahms to sex to Heidegger to Helen of Troy. And as she contemplates aspects of the troubled past which have brought her to her present state--obviously a metaphor for ultimate loneliness--so too will her drama become one of the few certifiably original fictions of our time. ""The novel I liked best this year,"" said the Washington Times upon the book's publication in 1988; ""one dizzying, delightful, funny passage after another . . .

The Kristeva Reader,"['Julia Kristeva', 'Toril Moi']",1986-01,['Die Vrou'],"Since the late 1980s, Brazilians of Japanese descent have been return migrating to Japan as unskilled foreign workers. With an immigrant population currently estimated at roughly 280,000, Japanese Brazilians are now the second largest group of foreigners in Japan. Although they are of Japanese descent, most were born in Brazil and are culturally Brazilian. As a result, they have become Japan's newest ethnic minority.Drawing upon close to two years of multisite fieldwork in Brazil and Japan, Takeyuki Tsuda has written a comprehensive ethnography that examines the ethnic experiences and reactions of both Japanese Brazilian immigrants and their native Japanese hosts. In response to their socioeconomic marginalization in their ethnic homeland, Japanese Brazilians have strengthened their Brazilian nationalist sentiments despite becoming members of an increasingly well-integrated transnational migrant community. Although such migrant nationalism enables them to resist assimilationist Japanese cultural pressures, its challenge to Japanese ethnic attitudes and ethnonational identity remains inherently contradictory.Strangers in the Ethnic Homeland illuminates how cultural encounters caused by transnational migration can reinforce local ethnic identities and nationalist discourses.",N/A,N/A

The Awakening,['Kate Chopin'],2011-09,['Literary Criticism'],"2011 Reprint of 1899 Edition. ""The Awakening"" is a novel by Kate Chopin, first published in 1899. Set in New Orleans and the Southern Louisiana coast at the end of the nineteenth century, the plot centers around Edna Pontellier and her struggle to reconcile her increasingly unorthodox views on femininity and motherhood with the prevailing social attitudes of the turn-of-the-century South. It is one of the earliest American novels to focus on women's issues without condescension. It is also widely seen as a landmark work of early feminism. The novel's blend of realistic narrative, incisive social commentary, and psychological complexity makes ""The Awakening"" a precursor of American modernism and prefigures the works of American novelists such as William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway and echoes the works of contemporaries such as Edith Wharton and Henry James. It can also be considered among the first Southern works in a tradition that would culminate with the modern masterpieces of Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, and Tennessee Williams.",N/A,N/A

His only defense is three women, on a farm at the end of the lane. The youngest of them claims that her duckpond is an ocean. The oldest can remember the Big Bang. THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE is a fable that reshapes modern fantasy: moving, terrifying and elegiac - as pure as a dream, as delicate as a butterfly's wing, as dangerous as a knife in the dark.",N/A,N/A

Friday,['Robert Anson Heinlein'],1982,['Fiction'],"A CAEZIK Notable book. CAEZIK Notables is a series of speculative-fiction books marking important milestones in science fiction or fantasy. Each book published in the series has a new introduction highlighting the book's significance within the genre. ""A charming protagonist in a story as sleekly engineered as a starship. This one should fly.""--Publishers Weekly Friday is a secret courier and ardent lover. Employed by a man she only knows of as ""Boss"", she is given the most awkward and dangerous cases, which take her from New Zealand to Canada, and through the new States of America's disunion, all the way out into the stars and the new colony of Botany Bay. Thrust into one calamity after another, she uses her enhanced wits and very many skills to evade, seduce or even kill her way out of any sticky situation she finds herself in. For she is both superior and inferior to the average human. As an AP--artificial person--the best humanity has to offer has been written into Friday's DNA. Yet she is often treated like a second-class citizen--if she were ever able to claim citizenship. Her mother was the test tube and her father the knife, as the saying goes, so she has less rights than the biologically-born human, and no soul, according to the church. But in Friday Heinlein has created one of the most enlightened, warm, engaging, and humane characters in the science fiction field, gifting us a novel of female empowerment that was well ahead of its time.

Marianne was still handsomer. Her form, though not so correct as her sister's ... was more striking'As the title of Jane Austen's first published novel suggests, the difference between two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, lies not only in their appearance but also in their temperament. Yet Sense and Sensibility not only contrasts Elinor's good sense, her readiness to observe social forms and Marianne's impulsive candour, her warm but excessive sensibility; it also highlights their shared predicament in the face of a competitive marriage market. The sisters' parallel experience of love, and its threatened loss, causes both to readjust and question their own values. Jane Austen's satirical powers of observation and expression spare no one in this lively study of the constraints placed on gentry women in the eighteenth century.Ros Ballaster's introduction to this new Penguin Classics edition discusses Sense and Sensibility as domestic drama and as critique of the wider aesthetic, social and political concerns of Romanticism.",N/A,N/A

"Women, Crusading and the Holy Land in Historical Narrative",['Natasha R. Hodgson'],2007,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Women's role in crusades and crusading examined through a close investigation of the narratives in which they appear. Narratives of crusading have often been overlooked as a source for the history of women because of their focus on martial events, and perceptions about women inhibiting the recruitment and progress of crusading armies. Yet women consistently appeared in the histories of crusade and settlement, performing a variety of roles. While some were vilified as ""useless mouths"" or prostitutes, others undertook menial tasks for the army, went on crusade with retinuesof their own knights, and rose to political prominence in the Levant and and the West. This book compares perceptions of women from a wide range of historical narratives including those eyewitness accounts, lay histories andmonastic chronicles that pertained to major crusade expeditions and the settler society in the Holy Land. It addresses how authors used events involving women and stereotypes based on gender, family role, and social status in writing their histories: how they blended historia and fabula, speculated on women's motivations, and occasionally granted them a literary voice in order to connect with their audience, impart moral advice, and justify the crusade ideal.

The Conspiracy Club,['Jonathan Kellerman'],2003,['Detective and mystery stories'],"Dedicated young psychologist Dr. Jeremy Carrier is unschooled in the ways of violent crime and incalculable evil - until his life is irreversibly touched by both. When his romance with nurse Jocelyn Banks is cut short by her kidnapping and brutal murder, he is left emotionally devastated and being warily eyed by police seeking a prime suspect in the unsolved killing. To escape the pain, he buries himself in his work. But when more women turn up murdered in the same gruesome fashion as Jocelyn, the suspicion surrounding Jeremy intensifies and the only way for him to prove his innocence is to follow the trail of a cunning psychopath. Spurring on Jeremy's investigation is Dr. Arthur Chess, an enigmatic pathologist who harbors a keen fascination with the darker deeds committed by the living. Arthur draws Jeremy into the confidence of a cryptic society devoted to matters unknown and unspoken. But when Arthur suddenly slips away, Jeremy is left to contend with an onslaught of anonymous clues - and the growing realization that a harrowing game of cat and mouse has been set in motion.",N/A,N/A
Women and the Genesis of Christianity,"['Ben Witherington (III)', 'Ben Witherington']",1990-06-29,['Religion'],"This book presents in as clear a way as possible the New Testament material dealing with women and their roles in the context of the movement Jesus began. Dr Witherington begins by illustrating the roles of women in Judaism, in the Hellenistic world, and in the Roman Empire. She goes on to show how Jesus broke significantly with convention in the way he viewed women and their roles, offering as he did a wholly new conception of the legitimate rights of women in society. An analysis follows of the apostle Paul's attitude toward women, which shows how he agreed with and differed from the ideas of his contemporaries. The concluding chapters discuss the evangelists, whose selection and presentation of material with respect to women casts much light on the early Church's understanding of women and their roles. This comprehensive survey, which avoids slanting its material to serve a modern patriarchal or feminist bias, comes to the exciting conclusion that we can see in the New Testament an attempt to reform the patriarchal orientation of the day.",N/A,N/A

Girls and Their Comics,['Jacqueline Danziger-Russell'],2013,['Antiques & Collectibles'],"In America, comics and comic books have often been associated with adolescent male fantasy—muscle-bound superheroes and scantily clad women. Nonetheless, comics have also been read and enjoyed by girls. While there have been many strong representations of women throughout their history, the comics of today have evolved and matured, becoming a potent medium in which to explore the female experience, particularly that of girlhood and adolescence. In Girls and Their Comics: Finding a Female Voice in Comic Book Narrative, Jacqueline Danziger-Russell contends that comics have a unique place in the representation of female characters. She discusses the overall history of the comic book, paying special attention to girls’ comics, showing how such works relate to a female point of view. While examining the concept of visual literacy, Danziger-Russell asserts that comics are an excellent space in which the marginalized voices of girls may be expressed. This volume also includes a chapter on manga (Japanese comics), which explains the genesis of girls’ comics in Japan and their popularity with girls in the United States. Including interviews with librarians, comic creators, and girls who read comics and manga, Girls and Their Comics is an important examination of the growing interest in comic books among young females and will appeal to a wide audience, including literary theorists, teachers, librarians, popular culture and women’s studies scholars, and comic book historians.",N/A,N/A

Women and History: The creation of patriarchy,['Gerda Lerner'],1986,"['Civilization, Western']","A major new work by a leading historian and pioneer in Women's Studies, The Creation of Patriarchy is a radical reconceptualization of the history of Western civilization that makes gender central to its analysis. The author argues that male dominance over women is the product of historicaldevelopment and is not ""natural"" or biological and hence unchangeable. Therefore patriarchy as a system of organizing society can be ended by historical process.Lerner focuses on the contradiction between women's central role in creating society and their marginality in the meaning-giving process of interpretation and explanation. This fascinating paradox leads her to an exploration of nearly 2,600 years of human history and into the cultures of theancient Near East, notably the Mesopotamian and ancient Hebrew societies, from whence the major gender metaphors of Western civilization are largely derived. Using historical, literary, archeological, and artistic evidence, Lerner traces the development of the leading ideas, symbols and metaphorsby which partiarchal gender relations were incorporated into Western civilization.The book abounds with brilliant--and controversial--insights. Lerner propounds a startling new theory of class, showing the different ways in which class is structured for and experienced by men and women. She locates the origins of slavery in the earlier practice of ""exchanging women"" inmarriage among tribes and shows that women of conquered tribes were the first slaves. In addition, the book contends that the exclusion of women from the role of mediator with the Divine--the dethroning of the fertility goddess and priestesses and the conceptualizing of men and women as essentiallydifferent creatures in Greek philosophy--represented the decisive turning points in the way gender is symbolized in Western civilization.About the Author:Gerda Lerner is Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and author of such books as Black Women in White America, The Female Experience: An American Documentary, and The Majority Finds Its Past: Placing Women in History.Features:A pioneer in women's studies radically restructures the history of Western civilization in terms of gender* Traces the development of the ideas and symbols by which the patriarchal system emerged* Certain to stir controversy in a wide range of intellectual circles",N/A,N/A
