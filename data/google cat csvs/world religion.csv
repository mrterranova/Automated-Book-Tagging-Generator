Ending the Troubles,"['John M. Burney', 'Andrew J. Auge']",2024-10-29,['History'],"In June 1996, the British government convened multiparty talks trying to establish peace within Northern Ireland, after thirty years of bloody civil war based on religious, cultural, political, and economic tensions, known as ""The Troubles."" The talks included political parties from the two factions central to the conflict: Unionists, largely Protestants committed to retaining Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, and Nationalists, largely Catholics committed to the reunification of Northern Ireland with the independent Republic of Ireland. Fundamental questions on national identity and democracy quickly turned these proceedings into faction bickering, thus failing to produce any substantive progress. The emergence of new leaders in 1997—Tony Blair, prime minister of Great Britian, and Bertie Ahern, taoiseach in the Republic of Ireland—created an opportunity for reenergizing the talks chaired by the former US senator George Mitchell, with all parties making a concerted effort to reach a viable resolution among Nationalists and Unionists. In the game, students will represent the major parties in Northern Ireland as they reconvene at the multiparty talks in 1997 to find ways to reconcile two competing visions of Northern Irish nationalism, or at least find a way for each community to tolerate one another's participation in a common constitutional arrangement. Much is at stake, for another failure could lead to a full resumption of the civil war.",N/A,N/A,en
"Race, Class, and Nationalism in the Twenty-First-Century Caribbean","['Scott Timcke', 'Shelene Gomes']",2024-11,['History'],"This collection of more than a dozen essays focuses on the political dynamics of race, class, and nationalism in the contemporary Caribbean. Despite the plethora of studies on nationalism in the Caribbean, few have attempted to look at the phenomenon as a political invention that does not—and cannot—serve the interests of all: how essentialist, reductive, overdetermining nationalism is a political and conceptual confusion that forever stalls the project of universal human emancipation. Editors Scott Timcke and Shelene Gomes gather and frame chapters that, in their collective expression, help trace the process of race, class, and nationalism through the contours of a broader political, economic, and social geography. These chapters argue that notions of racial identity have changed over time, but those reformations are not independent of class rule or nationalism. By using several case studies that span the Anglo, Dutch, French, and Spanish Caribbean and focus on the development of political organizations, hardships, and ideology, each of these essays continues the struggle for liberation against elite entrenchment.",N/A,N/A,en

Escape from Communism,['Dumitru Sandru'],2013-11-10,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Life under communism is cruel and inhumane. Commit the smallest political infraction, and the secret police will arrest you. The only ray of hope is the West, but getting out from communism is difficult. Communist countries have a “Berlin Wall” around them. It is a crime to escape by crossing the border illegally, and anyone caught is beaten and imprisoned, sometimes even shot. I was eighteen, and I was living in hell. However, I would rather have died than keep living as a communist slave. This is my story of what happened and how I reached freedom.",N/A,N/A,en

Death to the Infidels,['Mitchell Bard'],2025-06-25,['Political Science'],"For more than a century, much of the attention given to the Middle East has focused on the Arab-Israeli conflict. The rise of a Palestinian offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, transformed the nature of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. According to Bard, the dispute, in the view of Hamas, is not over a division of Palestine, but rather about Jews ruling over Muslims and the presence of Jews on Islamic land. However, this Islamic-Jewish conflict is not simply confined to the Middle East. Muslim terrorist attacks have been directed at Jews all around the world, from Europe to Asia to Latin America. Radical Muslims in European countries are becoming more brazen, particularly in France, where the Muslims constitute nearly ten percent of the population. In just the last year, there have been several Muslim attacks on Jews throughout France. Death to the Infidels documents the growth of radical Islam in the Middle East and how, from the author's interpretation, it has transformed what had primarily been a political conflict into a one-sided religious war limiting the prospect for peace, particularly in Israel.",N/A,N/A,en
American Journalists in the Great War,['Chris Dubbs'],2017-03,['Biography & Autobiography'],"When war erupted in Europe in 1914, American journalists hurried across the Atlantic ready to cover it the same way they had covered so many other wars. However, very little about this war was like any other. Its scale, brutality, and duration forced journalists to write their own rules for reporting and keeping the American public informed. American Journalists in the Great War tells the dramatic stories of the journalists who covered World War I for the American public. Chris Dubbs draws on personal accounts from contemporary newspaper and magazine articles and books to convey the experiences of the journalists of World War I, from the western front to the Balkans to the Paris Peace Conference. Their accounts reveal the challenges of finding the war news, transmitting a story, and getting it past the censors. Over the course of the war, reporters found that getting their scoop increasingly meant breaking the rules or redefining the very meaning of war news. Dubbs shares the courageous, harrowing, and sometimes humorous stories of the American reporters who risked their lives in war zones to record their experiences and send the news to the people back home.",N/A,N/A,en
Weeds Like Us,['Gunter Nitsch'],2008,['Biography & Autobiography'],"The uprooting of seven million civilians - women, children, and elderly men - from their homes in the German provinces of East Prussia, Pomerania, and Silesia following World War II is largely unknown in the United States. Weeds Like Us is a gripping true adventure story about the author's own East Prussian family. The author's earliest years were spent in relative comfort on his grandfather's farm in East Prussia during World War II. For him, life in Hitler's Germany was the natural order of things. Then, in January 1945, just after the author's seventh birthday, the Russians rolled into East Prussia. Full of unexpected twists and turns, Weeds Like Us tells the story of what happened over the next six years, as the author's family tried to make its way safely to the West.",N/A,N/A,en

The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism,['Juan María Laboa'],2003,['Religion'],"From common origins, both African and Middle Eastern, Christian monasticism travels along two parallel streams, branched and informed by mutual influences: the Eastern and the Western. In The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism historians have collaborated to examine the history of Christianity and provide a work of reference where East and West meet and are mutually enriched. The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism brings together many voices speaking from different influences. Russians, Serbians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Latins, Anglosaxons, Americans, Germans, and others serve at the same time as co-authors and readers of a diverse reality that is a common property of Christianity. The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism bears witness to the twofold Christian paradox: on the one hand, ""being in the world without being worldly,"" while the very monastics who have most fully embodied that statement also show us the other side of the paradox, namely, that monasticism has changed the world and even its natural and cultural landscape. Without centuries of monasticism the world would be a different place. Through its engaging text and use of 59 full-color illustrated maps to detail specific locations of important places and events, The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism points out some of the religious goals and thoughts most pursued and most clearly present in the great representatives of the surprising and moving history of monasticism. Chapters are ?Universality of the Monastic Phenomenon, ? ?The Origins of Christian Monasticism, ? ?Early Christian Monasticism, ? ?The Western Monastic Tradition, ? ?Development of Monasticism in the East, ? ?Development of Monasticism in the West, ? ?A Millennium of Christian Monasticism in the East, ? and ?A Millennium of Christian Monasticism in the West.?",N/A,N/A,en
The Harper Atlas of World History,"['Harper & Row, Publishers']",1987,['History'],"""Full of facts, interpretation, and explanation, The Harper Atlas of World History follows the history of mankind through the ages and through-out the world. From the appearance of prehistoric Homo habilis to the Middle Eastern wars of the late twentieth century, from the building of the first Egyptian pyramids to the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, the atlas traces the history of the world through individual cultures, political systems, and societies. Each double-page spread is devoted to a specific trend or event in world history, presented from four different viewpoints: Maps that depict a particular aspect of a society--including frontiers, conquests, natural resources, and geographic and demographic evolution--at a given moment ; Text that describes the patterns of an era or a society. A single entry includes everything from political evolution, population expansion, and prosperity to war, economic crises, and political, economic, and societal reform ; Chronology that indicates the important dates and events of the period under consideration ; Full-color illustrations portraying the art and architecture of the time, as well as photographs of the people, places, and events of the later eras.""--book jacket.",N/A,N/A,en

The difference is that Mez not only escaped from his 'trial by parent' but he discovered a hope that has transformed his life. He in turn has helped others find hope in their lives.

Nevertheless, although his story at times may sicken you, his first brushes with the faith that restored him will make you laugh out loud!
