Weeds Like Us,['Gunter Nitsch'],2008,['Biography & Autobiography'],"The uprooting of seven million civilians - women, children, and elderly men - from their homes in the German provinces of East Prussia, Pomerania, and Silesia following World War II is largely unknown in the United States. Weeds Like Us is a gripping true adventure story about the author's own East Prussian family. The author's earliest years were spent in relative comfort on his grandfather's farm in East Prussia during World War II. For him, life in Hitler's Germany was the natural order of things. Then, in January 1945, just after the author's seventh birthday, the Russians rolled into East Prussia. Full of unexpected twists and turns, Weeds Like Us tells the story of what happened over the next six years, as the author's family tried to make its way safely to the West.",N/A,N/A,en

American Journalists in the Great War,['Chris Dubbs (Military historian)'],2017,['Biography & Autobiography'],"When war erupted in Europe in 1914, American journalists hurried across the Atlantic ready to cover it the same way they had covered so many other wars. However, very little about this war was like any other. Its scale, brutality, and duration forced journalists to write their own rules for reporting and keeping the American public informed. American Journalists in the Great War tells the dramatic stories of the journalists who covered World War I for the American public. Chris Dubbs draws on personal accounts from contemporary newspaper and magazine articles and books to convey the experiences of the journalists of World War I, from the western front to the Balkans to the Paris Peace Conference. Their accounts reveal the challenges of finding the war news, transmitting a story, and getting it past the censors. Over the course of the war, reporters found that getting their scoop increasingly meant breaking the rules or redefining the very meaning of war news. Dubbs shares the courageous, harrowing, and sometimes humorous stories of the American reporters who risked their lives in war zones to record their experiences and send the news to the people back home.",N/A,N/A,en

It examines the development of civilizations in the Near East - Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian - as well as those in Europe - the Minoans, Etruscans and Celts. Across the continents of Africa, Asia and America, it covers such subjects as Egypt from its pre-dynastic roots to the age of the Pharaohs, China during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the great cities of the Incas and Aztecs.

"Race, Class, and Nationalism in the Twenty-First-Century Caribbean","['Scott Timcke', 'Shelene Gomes']",2024-11,['History'],"This collection of more than a dozen essays focuses on the political dynamics of race, class, and nationalism in the contemporary Caribbean. Despite the plethora of studies on nationalism in the Caribbean, few have attempted to look at the phenomenon as a political invention that does not—and cannot—serve the interests of all: how essentialist, reductive, overdetermining nationalism is a political and conceptual confusion that forever stalls the project of universal human emancipation. Editors Scott Timcke and Shelene Gomes gather and frame chapters that, in their collective expression, help trace the process of race, class, and nationalism through the contours of a broader political, economic, and social geography. These chapters argue that notions of racial identity have changed over time, but those reformations are not independent of class rule or nationalism. By using several case studies that span the Anglo, Dutch, French, and Spanish Caribbean and focus on the development of political organizations, hardships, and ideology, each of these essays continues the struggle for liberation against elite entrenchment.",N/A,N/A,en

The Populist Explosion,['John B. Judis'],2016,['History'],"From the author of THE POLITICS OF OUR TIME What's happening in global politics, and is there a thread that ties it all together? There is, and it is called populism. What is populism? And why have populist parties and candidates suddenly sprung up and even gained power in the United States and Western Europe? The emergence of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, France's Marine LePen, Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, and the Alternative for Germany are signs that an older consensus about politics and government is breaking down. John B. Judis, one of America's most respected political analysts, tells us why we need to understand the populist movement that began in the United States in the 1890s and whose politics have recurred on both sides of the Atlantic ever since. The Populist Explosion is essential reading for anyone hoping to grasp a global political system that is only just beginning what will be a long-running and highly consequential readjustment.

Airline Maps,"['Mark Ovenden', 'Maxwell J. Roberts']",2019,['Business & Economics'],"In this gorgeously illustrated collection of airline route maps, Mark Ovenden and Maxwell Roberts look to the skies and transport readers to another time. Hundreds of images span a century of passenger flight, from the rudimentary trajectory of routes to the most intricately detailed birds-eye views of the land to be flown over. Advertisements for the first scheduled commercial passenger flights featured only a few destinations, with stunning views of the countryside and graphics of biplanes. As aviation took off, speed and mileage were trumpeted on bold posters featuring busy routes. Major airlines produced highly stylized illustrations of their global presence, establishing now-classic brands. With trendy and forward-looking designs, cartographers celebrated the coming together of different cultures and made the earth look ever smaller. Eventually, fleets got bigger and routes multiplied, and graphic designers have found creative new ways to display huge amounts of information. Airline hubs bring their own cultural mark and advertise their plentiful destination options. Innovative maps depict our busy world with webs of overlapping routes and networks of low-cost city-to-city hopping. But though flying has become more commonplace, Ovenden and Roberts remind us that early air travel was a glamorous affair for good reason. Airline Maps is a celebration of graphic design, cartographic skills and clever marketing, and a visual feast that reminds us to enjoy the journey as much as the destination.",N/A,N/A,en

Ending the Troubles,"['John M. Burney', 'Andrew J. Auge']",2024-10-29,['History'],"In June 1996, the British government convened multiparty talks trying to establish peace within Northern Ireland, after thirty years of bloody civil war based on religious, cultural, political, and economic tensions, known as ""The Troubles."" The talks included political parties from the two factions central to the conflict: Unionists, largely Protestants committed to retaining Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, and Nationalists, largely Catholics committed to the reunification of Northern Ireland with the independent Republic of Ireland. Fundamental questions on national identity and democracy quickly turned these proceedings into faction bickering, thus failing to produce any substantive progress. The emergence of new leaders in 1997—Tony Blair, prime minister of Great Britian, and Bertie Ahern, taoiseach in the Republic of Ireland—created an opportunity for reenergizing the talks chaired by the former US senator George Mitchell, with all parties making a concerted effort to reach a viable resolution among Nationalists and Unionists. In the game, students will represent the major parties in Northern Ireland as they reconvene at the multiparty talks in 1997 to find ways to reconcile two competing visions of Northern Irish nationalism, or at least find a way for each community to tolerate one another's participation in a common constitutional arrangement. Much is at stake, for another failure could lead to a full resumption of the civil war.",N/A,N/A,en

Contrary to popular belief, world hunger is not the result of scarcity of resources or overpopulation. Rather, hunger is caused by the inequality in control over food producing resources. The solution to these inequalities is not more advanced technologies, agribusiness, or foreign aid. The redistribution of control over food-producing resources can result in greater food production. Democratic participation in deciding how production will be used is the only insurance that it will benefit the producers. However, land redistribution alone isnot adequate; peasant classes must work for land reform and organize to protect their own interests.",N/A,N/A,en

Herbert Corey’s Great War,['Herbert Corey'],2022-06,['Biography & Autobiography'],"In 1914, the Associated Newspapers sent correspondent Herbert Corey to Europe on the day Great Britain declared war on Germany. During the Great War that followed, Corey reported from France, Britain, and Germany, visiting the German lines on both the western and eastern fronts. He also reported from Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, and Serbia. When the Armistice was signed in November 1918, Corey defied the rules of the American Expeditionary Forces and crossed into Germany. He covered the Paris Peace Conference the following year. No other foreign correspondent matched the longevity of his reporting during World War I. Until recently, however, his unpublished memoir lay largely unnoticed among his papers in the Library of Congress. With publication of Herbert Corey’s Great War, coeditors Peter Finn and John Maxwell Hamilton reestablish Corey’s name in the annals of American war reporting. As a correspondent, he defies easy comparison. He approximates Ernie Pyle in his sympathetic interest in the American foot soldier, but he also told stories about troops on the other side and about noncombatants. He is especially illuminating on the obstacles reporters faced in conveying the story of the Great War to Americans. As his memoir makes clear, Corey didn’t believe he was in Europe to serve the Allies. He viewed himself as an outsider, one who was deeply ambivalent about the entry of the United States into the war. His idiosyncratic, opinionated, and very American voice makes for compelling reading.",N/A,N/A,en

The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism,['Juan María Laboa'],2003,['Religion'],"From common origins, both African and Middle Eastern, Christian monasticism travels along two parallel streams, branched and informed by mutual influences: the Eastern and the Western. In The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism historians have collaborated to examine the history of Christianity and provide a work of reference where East and West meet and are mutually enriched. The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism brings together many voices speaking from different influences. Russians, Serbians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Latins, Anglosaxons, Americans, Germans, and others serve at the same time as co-authors and readers of a diverse reality that is a common property of Christianity. The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism bears witness to the twofold Christian paradox: on the one hand, ""being in the world without being worldly,"" while the very monastics who have most fully embodied that statement also show us the other side of the paradox, namely, that monasticism has changed the world and even its natural and cultural landscape. Without centuries of monasticism the world would be a different place. Through its engaging text and use of 59 full-color illustrated maps to detail specific locations of important places and events, The Historical Atlas of Eastern and Western Christian Monasticism points out some of the religious goals and thoughts most pursued and most clearly present in the great representatives of the surprising and moving history of monasticism. Chapters are ?Universality of the Monastic Phenomenon, ? ?The Origins of Christian Monasticism, ? ?Early Christian Monasticism, ? ?The Western Monastic Tradition, ? ?Development of Monasticism in the East, ? ?Development of Monasticism in the West, ? ?A Millennium of Christian Monasticism in the East, ? and ?A Millennium of Christian Monasticism in the West.?",N/A,N/A,en

Escape from Communism,['Dumitru Sandru'],2013-11-10,['Biography & Autobiography'],"Life under communism is cruel and inhumane. Commit the smallest political infraction, and the secret police will arrest you. The only ray of hope is the West, but getting out from communism is difficult. Communist countries have a “Berlin Wall” around them. It is a crime to escape by crossing the border illegally, and anyone caught is beaten and imprisoned, sometimes even shot. I was eighteen, and I was living in hell. However, I would rather have died than keep living as a communist slave. This is my story of what happened and how I reached freedom.",N/A,N/A,en

Through hundreds of Russian-language sources, Dr. Aron shows how Putin uses militarist propaganda and sanitized revisionist images of World War II, Stalin, and the Soviet Union to forge a nationalist and loyal core of his regime's support. And the ""new Russia"" suddenly looks a lot like the old USSR.Dr. Aron's bold, expert analysis of Russian political culture under Putin helps us better understand Russia's revanchist tendencies, its invasion of Ukraine, and the perilous road ahead.",N/A,N/A,en
Atlas,['Tom Harper'],2018,['Atlases'],"From the publication in 1595 of the first 'atlas' by Flemish cartographer Gerhard Mercator, the term has become a universally adopted title for books containing accurate, uniform, and evenly spread maps of all or some of the world. This is an atlas with a difference. Few of the maps in this book could reasonably be called 'accurate' in the modern sense and could almost certainly not be used to plan a journey. Yet this atlas can help us to travel in a way that regular atlases do not, because by looking at old maps and getting to know their stories we can be transported back to the times in which they were made.The generous, full-colour illustrations of each map in this book range from the Klencke Atlas to Hokusai's Map of China, from a 1682 pirate map of Guatemala to 20th-century cartographic postcards featuring maps of Australia. Atlas is the definitive printed showcase of the British Library's extensive and unparalleled map collection.--",N/A,N/A,en

The Failed Experiment,['George Otieno'],2023-12-22,[],"""The Failed Experiment: Why Democracy is Failing in Africa"" offers a provocative and insightful examination of the complex challenges facing democratic systems across the African continent. This book delves into the intricate tapestry of historical, cultural, and global influences that have shaped Africa's political landscape. It thoughtfully explores how colonial legacies, ethnic diversities, external interventions, and economic struggles have interplayed with the ideals of democracy. Through compelling case studies, the book dissects the nuanced realities of African nations, revealing how traditional democratic models often clash with the continent's collectivist cultures and socio-economic dynamics. The author navigates through issues of corruption, neocolonialism, and the impact of international aid, presenting a critical analysis of why Western-style democracy struggles to take root in African soil. This book is an essential read for anyone seeking to understand the intricacies of African political systems and the future of democracy in a context vastly different from the West.",N/A,N/A,en

But this is not just another harrowing story about an excruciating childhood and the ravages on a life it produces. The difference is that Mez not only escaped from his 'trial by parent' but he discovered a hope that has transformed his life. He in turn has helped others find hope in their lives. Mez's story is told with a frankness and wit that hides much of the pain and despair that was his everyday experience. Nevertheless, although his story at times may sicken you, his first brushes with the faith that restored him will make you laugh out loud! Mez's life involved abuse, violence, drugs, thieving and prison - but you don't have to fall as far as him in order to climb out of the traps in your life. Do you like happy endings?

Cette notion, soit présentée tel un slogan pour contester les politiques migratoires, soit brandie pour dénigrer toute tentative de penser ces politiques hors du strict contrôle migratoire, fait en effet l'objet d'un traitement très clivant dans l'espace public. Cet ouvrage propose une prise de recul nécessaire en apportant à des éléments à la fois théoriques et tirés de l'expérience vécue des migrants : mise en perspective des dynamiques historiques de la liberté de circulation, présentation des grands espaces de circulation existants, les migrations humaines au regard des migrations de capitaux et marchandises, les formes de circulation mises en oeuvre par les migrants eux-mêmes, les imaginaires contradictoires sur le fait migratoire. Chaque partie est constitué d'une dizaine de planches faisant dialoguer des textes d'experts avec une iconographie riche et créative (cartes, dessins, photographies), et alternant des thématiques ""classiques"" aux sujets les plus actuels (pandémie, circulation des données, migrations des femmes, écologie...).Dans un paysage politique et médiatique qui place au centre de l'attention les entraves aux mouvements, cet atlas vient ainsi contribuer aux débats sur le futur des politiques migratoires, et ouvrir le champ des possibles.",N/A,N/A,fr

A Journey Back in Time Through Maps,['BROWN'],2023-09,['History'],"In our modern day and age, when satellite imagery and GPS services like Google Maps, offer strikingly accurate images of the world, we can easily forget that for most of human history the world was an unknown tabula rasa on which cartographers, scientists, men of god, and kings imprinted their own dreams and ideals. This new extended edition, with the addition of about 15 maps, explores changing perceptions of the world map through the centuries and across multiple vastly different cultures. We will juxtapose 18th century Buddhist cartography in Japan with European mercantile maps of the same period. We will travel with speculative cartographers and they argue in the scientific academies of Paris, London, and St. Petersburg over theories about what 'must' fill the great unknown. We will observe the emergence of the modern world view through the cartographic lens. We will see how, much like reading a long lost childhood diary, old maps are touching earnest reminders that our former selves' knowledge and perception of the world are rich and limited at the same time. AUTHOR: Kevin J Brown is a rare map dealer based in Brooklyn, New York. He is the owner of Geographicus Rare Antique Maps, is one of the largest and most active firms specialising in antiquarian cartography in the United States. He has dealt with countless rare maps from all periods covering all regions. Kevin continues to have a passion for rare maps and always looks forward his next cartographic discovery.",N/A,N/A,en

A Synthesis of the World Literature of Ice Hockey Injuries,"['M. J. Stuart', 'B. J. Crawford', 'K. A. Dajani', 'M. L. Gill', 'A. A. Link']",2008,['Bruch'],"Ice hockey is a fast-paced, aggressive sport whose participants are subject to relatively high rates of injury. Although there is a growing emphasis on the epidemiology of ice hockey research and its application towards reducing injuries, the literature has never been organized into an accessible database. Ice hockey is played in North America, Europe, Scandinavia, the U.K., and several other non-English speaking countries, yet injury reports not written in English are often ignored in review articles. The purpose of this project was to synthesize the existing world literature on ice hockey injuries into a framework of epidemiologic criteria, accessible in an organized, retrievable library. An extensive search of the following databases was done: MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, NTIS, CURRENT CONTENTS, DISSERTATION ABSTRACTS, SPORT DISCUS, CINAHL, and WEB OF SCIENCE. Key words used were ""ice hockey"" and ""injuries,"" and the search range was 1966 to July 2007. Endnote X (Thompson Corp., Stamford, CT) was used for reference compilation. Eight hundred sixty seven documents were catalogued, from 27 countries in 8 languages. Documents were first categorized by type, including injury (226), equipment (45), case reports (94), review articles (294), editorials (39), or as focusing on the physiological, psychological, or medical aspects of ice hockey (169). Documents were then subdivided by study type and whether they were prospective (117) or retrospective (109). Further subdivisions beyond these levels were based on the inclusion of certain critical epidemiological criteria, including exposure time, a clear definition of ""injury,"" and the level of play, among others. This comprehensive database should make future ice hockey research more efficient, as well as promote sound epidemiology and a more global perspective.",N/A,N/A,en

Atlas mondial des zones franches,['François Bost'],2010,['Commerce'],"Territoires destinés à attirer entreprises et activités exportatrices grâce aux avantages multiples et dérogatoires qui leur sont accordés, les zones franches constituent un excellent marqueur de la diffusion de la mondialisation à l'échelle planétaire. Les très nombreuses études de cas présentées dans cet atlas montrent que les zones franches jouent souvent un rôle significatif dans les pays qui en ont fait des outils et des leviers du développement, tant en matière de création d'emplois nouveaux et de formation de la main-d'oeuvre, de diversification de l'économie et des exportations que d'apport de devises fortes. Une équipe de seize géographes et de deux cartographes s'est ainsi fixé pour objectif ambitieux de dresser un tableau exhaustif et nuancé du "" phénomène "" zone franche à travers le monde, qui reste encore mal connu et très peu étudié. Au total, 1 735 zones franches aux statuts très divers ont été identifiées dans 133 pays, essentiellement dans le monde en développement et en Europe orientale. A l'heure de la délocalisation accélérée des activités industrielles et de services, de la montée en puissance des pays émergents, ou encore de la recherche effrénée de compétitivité de la part des entreprises, ce travail apporte une information inédite et originale qui place le lecteur au coeur de l'économie mondiale contemporaine et de ses ressorts.",N/A,N/A,fr
