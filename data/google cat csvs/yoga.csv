He illuminates every facet and phase of yoga from its roots in shamanism to its connections to the complex and dynamic spirituality of India, especially yoga's relationship with Hinduism and Buddhism. Feuerstein explicates the different yogic schools and profiles key yoga teachers.

The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali,['Patañjali'],1952,['Religion'],"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are in themselves exceedingly brief, yet they contain the essence of practical wisdom, set forth in admirable order and detail. The theme, if the present interpreter be right, is the great regeneration, the birth of the spiritual from the psychical man: the same theme which Paul so wisely and eloquently set forth in writing to his disciples in Corinth, the theme of all mystics in all lands. We think of ourselves as living a purely physical life, in these material bodies of ours. In reality, we have gone far indeed from pure physical life; for ages, our life has been psychical, we have been centred and immersed in the psychic nature. Some of the schools of India say that the psychic nature is, as it were, a looking-glass, wherein are mirrored the things seen by the physical eyes, and heard by the physical ears. But this is a magic mirror; the images remain, and take a certain life of their own. Thus within the psychic realm of our life there grows up an imaged world wherein we dwell; a world of the images of things seen and heard, and therefore a world of memories; a world also of hopes and desires, of fears and regrets. Mental life grows up among these images, built on a measuring and comparing, on the massing of images together into general ideas; on the abstraction of new notions and images from these; till a new world is built up within, full of desires and hates, ambition, envy, longing, speculation, curiosity, self-will, self-interest. The teaching of the East is, that all these are true powers overlaid by false desires; that though in manifestation psychical, they are in essence spiritual; that the psychical man is the veil and prophecy of the spiritual man.",N/A,N/A,en

The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali,"['Charles Johnston', 'Patanjali']",2012-01-01,['Health & Fitness'],"Yoga is an exercise and meditation philosophy that has been taking the United States by storm over the past several decades. Yet many are unaware that there is an entire, ancient religion that prefaces this phenomenon. Yoga is one of six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, and ""Yoga Sutras of Patanjali"" contains 196 aphorisms that form the basis of Raja Yoga. Patanjali uses his text to explain different facets of the philosophy, leading people to achieve kaivalya, the ultimate goal of detachment. The sutras begin with the most basic concentration, and then progresses to discipline, manifestation, and finally, emancipation of the transcendental ego. Patanjali also explains how one can find the path to kaivayla with the eight limbs of Yoga; non-violent thoughts, cleanliness, healthy living, meditation, and others are explained as essential actions to achieving self-liberation. Patanjali lived sometime between the 1st century BCE and the 5th century BCE. While all critics agree that Patanjali is the great compiler of the Yoga Sutras, many deliberate about whether or not he created the meditational philosophy. Some even speculate that Patanjali borrowed some of his sutras from other authors. Regardless, ""Yoga Sutras of Patanjali"" is now considered to be the leading authority on Yoga, and various editions are still in print over two-thousand years after the original publication.",N/A,N/A,en
Haṭha-Yoga,['Mikel Burley'],2000-01-01,['Health & Fitness'],"In this study, philosopher and hatha practitioner Mikel Burley places the soteriological system of hatha-yoga within its proper context, drawing attention to its continuity with Vedic religion, its initiatory pedagogical structure, and to the theoretical underpinnings of hatha practice. In particular, he examines the complex notion of a `subtle bodily matrix`--comprising vital channels (nadis), centres (cakras) and forces (prana)--which is so crucial to the discipline, this matrix being held to form, as it were, a bridge between the gross physical and mental spheres. Use is made of a wide range of source materials, including seminal texts in the hatha tradition such as the Hatha-Yoga-Pradipika and Gheranda-Samhita, as well as primary and secondary works from related streams of Indian thought. The author`s approach is both scholarly and accessible, making the study suitable for specialists, practitioners and general readers alike. Hatha-yoga is concerned with the most fundamental of matters: the development of an ethical and spiritually-oriented appreciation of humanity, the cultivation of maximal health and perceptual acuity, and the quest for Self-realisation. Absorbing and penetrating, Hatha-Yoga: Its Context, Theory and Practice makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of this subject.",5,N/A,en

Yoga Vashisht or Heaven Found,['Rishi Singh Gherwal'],N/A,['Religion'],"We have two Yoga Vashishts, one going under the name great, the other small. This is the small book; both hooks are the work of the Rishi Vashisht, and it is the book for those who are seeking truth but not for the ignorant. It is the best book on wisdom and gives seven states of wisdom by understanding the liberation easily to be attained, and it also gives us the seven states of ignorance. It gives spiritual food for those who hunger. ""No one can miss the God consciousness within,"" Swami Ram Tritha once said. It is true and I agree with the Swami. It is the best work for self realization. In it, one will find the answer to, who created this universe; the cause of and how to cure diseases. It reveals the mastery of the Kundalini, the Mother of the Universe, and her power; how to perform levitation, and the secret of the long lived Yogi. How to master mind, and control matter and all the miseries of the world. In the story of Bali, it gives us encouragement and faith, that even a great egoist can attain liberation,—the goal of the Yogi or the truth seeker. More than a year ago, I was at Los Angeles and for the first time, heard that the truth seekers were searching for this book. Many asked if I would get some copies of it, for them. I wrote to India and also tried here, but was unable to find a copy. I then advertised in Europe but could not find it there. A student of mine, in Los Angeles, brought a copy to my class but the owner refused to part with it, even when offered thirty dollars. I then decided to translate this work for the truth-seeker. The reader will find this work contains the records of spiritual truths, the secret doctrine or eternal teaching of the Munis and Rishis, of India. The ideals are wonderfully clear. They always begin on the gross and gradually take the student to a higher and finer stage of self realization. They do that because the thought, at first, is undeveloped, but step by step becomes finer and finer. The Hindus in their attempt to find a solution to the problems of life and death in the external world, failed, as the nations of the West do to-day. They found that the senses could not help them in the problems of life, therefore, they gave up the external world and turned their attentions upon the internal. They gave all their time to the study of the Atma, which gave them finally, the solution of the problems of life and death. Their teachings give us a glimpse of the Atma that is the Absolute. They found that the individual soul is no other than the Brahma, Himself.",N/A,N/A,en

Placing particular emphasis on the metaphysical schema which underlies both concepts, the author adeptly develops a new interpretation of the standard views on Samkhya and Yoga. Drawing upon existing sources and using insights from both Eastern and Western philosophy and religious practice, this comprehensive interpretation is respectful to the underlying spiritual purpose of the Indian systems. It serves to illuminate the relation between the theoretical and practical dimensions of Samkhya and Yoga. The book fills a gap in current scholarship and will be of interest to those concerned with Indology as well as philosophies in general and their similarities and differences with other traditions.",N/A,N/A,en

A History of Modern Yoga,['Elizabeth De Michelis'],2004,['Yoga'],"""A History of Modern Yoga traces the roots of Modern Yoga back to the spread of western esoteric ideas in 18th century Bengal's intellectual circles. In due course Raja Yoga, published by Vivekananda in 1896, became the seminal text of Modern Yoga largely because, the author shows, it reconfigured the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali along the lines of a then emerging New Age occultistic style of secularised and individualistically oriented religiosity. With regard to 20th century developments, this book proposes a four-fold typology of Modern Yoga comprising Modern Psychosomatic, Modern Meditational, Modern Postural and Modern Denominational forms. Iyengar Yoga, one of the most influential schools of Modern Postural Yoga, is then analyzed in the light of this framework, while the conclusion shows how a typical Modern Postural Yoga session may be interpreted to reveal the forms and contents of a healing ritual of secular religion.""--Bloomsbury Publishing.",N/A,N/A,en

He finally finds the peace and tranquility which come with self-knowledge when he meets and studies with the great sage Sri Ramana Maharishi. Paul Brunton was a British philosopher, mystic, traveler, and guru. He left a journalistic career to live among yogis, mystics, and holy men, and studied Eastern and Western esoteric teachings. Dedicating his life to an inward and spiritual quest, Brunton felt charged to communicate his experiences about what he learned in the East to others. His works had a major influence on the spread of Eastern mysticism to the West. Taking pains to express his thoughts in layperson's terms, Brunton was able to present what he learned from the Orient and from ancient tradition as a living wisdom. His writings express his view that meditation and the inward quest are not exclusively for monks and hermits, but will also support those living normal, active lives in the Western world.",N/A,N/A,en

The Seven Spiritual Laws of Yoga,"['Deepak Chopra', 'David Simon']",2005-08,['Health & Fitness'],"The spiritual power of yoga-from the ten million-copy bestselling author of The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success In recent years, yoga has exploded in popularity. Yet for most North Americans, yoga remains just another exercise routine-a good option if you want to increase flexibility or relieve stress. According to Deepak Chopra and David Simon, however, this simplistic view ignores the spiritual side of yoga-its profound power to unite body, mind, and spirit and bring about enlightenment. Now, in this new book, they show how everyone can explore yoga's spiritual dimension-and integrate all the layers of their lives. Yoga means ""union"" in Sanskrit, and the authors begin by exploring the eight traditional yoga branches-the entry points to this union. The branches address such things as behavior, attention, awareness, the senses, and energy, and only one of them, asana, corresponds to the ""positions"" or poses people typically associate with yoga. Chopra and Simon then show people how to understand the seven spiritual laws that govern nature-Pure Potentiality, Giving, Karma, Least Effort, Intention and Desire, Detachment, and Dharma-and how to integrate these laws into their daily lives using meditation, breathing, asana, and other yoga practices. Complete with more than 50 photographs illustrating yoga poses, this new Chopra blockbuster is essential for anyone who wants to embrace yoga's spiritual potential-and lead a happier, more abundant, more harmonious life. Deepak Chopra, MD (San Diego, CA), is one of the bestselling authors of the last 15 years. His New York Times bestselling books include The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, which has sold more than ten million copies, How to Know God, Perfect Health, and The Path to Love. He has been interviewed widely on programs such as Oprah, Larry King Live and Good Morning America (for The Chopra Center Cookbook, 047145404-4) and featured on the cover of Time.

Our Many Selves,"['Sri Aurobindo', 'Mother']",2003,['Philosophy'],"Many of us face the difficulty of trying to change something in our nature, only to find that it is either difficult or virtually impossible. The key to solving this problem actually lies in a deeper understanding of the true nature of our psychological being. We are actually composed of various different ""parts"" or ""planes"" of action that combine together, interact with one another and impinge upon one another. This understanding allows us to differentiate between a mental idea, a force of will, an emotional movement, a vital energy, or a physical structure, and thereby more clearly understand the results of our psychological efforts and growth activities.",N/A,N/A,en
